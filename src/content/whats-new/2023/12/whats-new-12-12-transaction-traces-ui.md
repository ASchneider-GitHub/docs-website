The new Transaction Traces UI now allows you to quickly understand all the data captured on your transaction traces to provide the contextual insights you need for faster root-cause analysis. You can even filter the UI view and expand/collapse specific features as needed so you can focus on key elements that are important for you.

With the updated Transaction Trace UI, now you can:
* **Instantly identify trace insights:** See all attributes from transaction traces directly in the UI, with a redesigned default view with time-consumed pie charts, comprehensive span details, and segments.
* **Quickly visualize and analyze traces:** Get to the root cause by leveraging updated functionality in the trace waterfall, allowing you to focus on specific span times for quicker resolution.
* **See latency at-a-glance:** Identify which segments are causing latency in a single view with the new latency pie chart visualization.
* **Easily export data for further analysis:** Share insights and collaborate more effectively using the CSV export of database queries.
