With the frequency of software releases increasing, sometimes to multiple times a day, identifying if an error was introduced by a particular version becomes challenging. New Relic Errors Inbox now supports version tracking & filtering so you can easily identify which version introduced the error, making detection and root cause identification even easier. With version tracking in New Relic Errors Inbox, you get:
* **Faster root cause identification:** Easily identify the version of the code release where newly detected errors were introduced so you can focus on fixing the code rather than finding the error. 
* **Accelerated issue resolution:** Reduce the steps and screens required to detect, identify, and resolve issues with less toil. 
* **Real-time error visibility:** Get an up-to-date summary of any new errors introduced by recent software releases and stay ahead of issues before they impact customers.
