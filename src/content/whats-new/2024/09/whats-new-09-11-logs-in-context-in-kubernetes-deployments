You can now view logs related to a kubernetes deployment directly in the kubernetes deployment view, making it easier to explore related logs without having to manually search through log data.

To get started, open a kubernetes deployment view and click the **Logs** tab. A logs view will open where you can explore logs related to your kubernetes deployment. 

In addition, we have added the Mini Overview Widget to the kubernetes deployment summary page, allowing you to view the total log count and the error log count associated with your kubernetes deployment. This widget contains the "See logs" button, which opens up the logs in context view for that kubernetes deployment.
