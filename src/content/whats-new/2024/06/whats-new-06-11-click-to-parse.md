# Query time parsing with click-to-parse
While the majority of valuable parsing information is automatically gathered during the ingestion of logs into the New Relic platform, building additional queries can be a very manual and labor-intensive exercise. The new click-to-parse productivity hack allows you to easily select any string from your log file, then parse out repeatable values for alpha-numeric input, reducing manual entry and time to create queries. With a single click you can parse any variables from string attributes without writing any additional script.


To get started:
1. [Read our blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/click-to-parse)
2. [Review our docs page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/query-time-parsing/)

# Ingest parsing with AI assistance
To increase the efficiency of capturing parsing rules upon ingest, we are expanding our public preview for our AI-powered ingest. This preview offers capabilities that allow you to:
* Translate plain language within logs into New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries, run NRQL queries, and render the results in plain language or visualize them as a chart or graph.
* Surface New Relic Lookout insights/anomaly data from logs in response to root cause analysis (RCA)-style prompts.
