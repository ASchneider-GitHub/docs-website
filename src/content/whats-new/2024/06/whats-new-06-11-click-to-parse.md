New Relic has released two tools to help streamline querying your logs: query time parsing and NRAI parsing assistance. 

## Query time parsing 

New Relic automatically ingests valuable data and metrics, but parsing that data with additional queries can be manual and labor-intensive. New Relic's query time parsing allows you to easily select any string from your log file and then parse out repeatable values for alpha-numeric input, reducing manual entry and time to create queries. You can parse variables from string attributes with a single click without writing any additional script.

To get started:
1. [Read our blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/click-to-parse)
2. [Review our docs page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/query-time-parsing/)
3. [Watch a step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvK6MlkvD6Y)

## Ingest parsing with AI assistance

We are expanding New Relic AI to help you create and troubleshoot parsing rules. This preview offers capabilities that can help:

* **Suggest parsing rules**: When you create a parsing rule in the UI, as NRAI to create the parsing rule for you. 
* **Explain parsing rules**: If you don't understand the parsing rule our AI suggests, you can ask AI to explain the rule and suggest an even more efficient one if available.
