While the majority of valuable parsing information is automatically gathered during the ingestion of logs into the New Relic platform, building additional queries can be labor-intensive. New Relic's click-to-parse productivity hack allows you to select any string from your log file easily and then parse out repeatable values for alpha-numeric input, reducing manual entry and time to create queries. You can parse any variables from string attributes with a single click without writing any additional script.

To get started:
1. [Read our blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/click-to-parse)
2. [Review our docs page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/query-time-parsing/)

## Ingest parsing with AI assistance

We are expanding our public preview for our AI-powered ingest to increase the efficiency of capturing parsing rules upon ingest. This preview offers capabilities that allow you to:

* Translate plain language within logs into New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries, run NRQL queries, and render the results in plain language or visualize them as charts or graphs.
* Surface New Relic Lookout insights and anomaly data from logs in response to root cause analysis (RCA)-style prompts.
