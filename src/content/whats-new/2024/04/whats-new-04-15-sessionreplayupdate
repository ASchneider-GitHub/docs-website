New Relic session replay allows you to accelerate problem resolution, enhance user experiences, and gain even deeper insights into user interactions. Starting May 15, session replay will be generally available. This means data captured during session replay will contribute to your overall monthly product usage and be charged per your existing order.

With New Relic session replay you can get:
* **Detailed video-like playback of user actions** to quickly identify bottlenecks and pain points in the user journey.
* **Access granular traces and error details** to identify the exact code responsible for performance issues and get to the root cause faster.
* **Manage user privacy** with client-side privacy obfuscation and encryption to help ensure the security of their data.

* **Next Steps:**
* **Continue using session replay:** No action needed if you want to keep using it. You'll be billed based on monthly product usage starting May 15.
* **Monitor usage:** Track your consumption within [browser application settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/#view-consumption) to understand your data ingest related to session replay.
* **Adjust sampling rates:** Reduce the number of users sessions recorded by modifying the sampling rate in your [browser application settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/#configure-sampling-rates). This will decrease data ingestion and its corresponding costs, if necessary.
* **Opt-out:** Turn off the toggle in your [browser application settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/#get-started) if you no longer wish to use session replay.
