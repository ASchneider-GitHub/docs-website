Now generally available, [New Relic AI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/) lets you turn complex telemetry data into actionable insights using everyday language and integrated platform experiences.

You can interact with New Relic AI via the “Ask AI” chat interface, [Query Your Data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#NRQL-console), [CodeStream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/codestream/start-here/what-is-codestream/), as well as a growing number of one-click embedded platform experiences, such as [logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#errors) and [errors inbox integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#stack-traces) to help you:
* Accelerate onboarding and identify monitoring coverage gaps.
* Surface deep insights without leaving your workflow.

To initiate your trial period, click the “Ask AI” button in the upper right hand corner of the New Relic platform navigation, and select “Start Trial” when prompted.
