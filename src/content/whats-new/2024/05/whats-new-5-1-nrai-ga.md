Now generally available to all eligible* customers, [New Relic AI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/) lets you turn complex telemetry data into actionable insights using everyday language and integrated platform experiences.

You can interact with New Relic AI via the “Ask AI” chat interface, [Query Your Data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#NRQL-console), [CodeStream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/codestream/start-here/what-is-codestream/), as well as a growing number of one-click embedded platform experiences, such as [logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#errors) and [errors inbox integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#stack-traces) to help you:
* Translate natural language into queries, and explain what query results mean for your system and business.
* Investigate system changes by analyzing your telemetry data and directing you to what needs your attention.
* Instrument your system, generate system health reports, and identify alert coverage gaps for full-stack observability.
