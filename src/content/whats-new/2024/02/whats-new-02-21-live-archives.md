Live archives, our innovative long-term logs storage solution, is generally available. Live archives helps you easily meet compliance requirements using a unique storage capability that stores log data for up to seven years in an active, hydrated, and enriched state, so that you can analyze historical logs faster and easier than before.

## Solution benefits and capabilities

- **Instant access**: Access archived logs instantly, because they never leave the New Relic Database (NRDB). Analyze your archived logs the same way you do as any other logs, using the same UI and workflows, with no extra work.
- **Eliminate toil**: Unlike other tools, live archives eliminates toilsome processes required to access your logs, such as rehydration, reloading, re-indexing logs, or moving data to multiple locations or tiers. With live archives, when you need to respond to compliance or audit requests, your logs are right where you expect them to be, without any additional steps.
- **Reduce costs**: Live archives eliminates the need to pay for ingress and egress, indexing, reformatting data, or the need for additional tools to manage compliance risks. 

## How to get started

New Relic live archives simplifies the way you approach long-term logs storage and analysis, streamlining the process into just a few simple steps. 

1. **Send logs**: Send your logs to New Relic, as usual. 
1. **Set retention periods**: You can choose a retention period from 120 days up to seven years, depending on your compliance needs.
1. **Choose which partitions to archive**: You don't need to archive every log for compliance. Your New Relic administrator can select specific log partitions for archiving.
1. **Query data in the logs UI**: Live archives logs are queryable alongside your other logs and the rest of your telemetry data, eliminating the data silos you may have dealt with using other long-term storage solutions. 
1. **Manage user permissions**: New Relic administrators can easily grant query permissions by assigning custom roles.
