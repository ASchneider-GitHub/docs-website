In the fast-paced world of engineering and observability, every second counts. The key to success lies in reducing your mean time to resolution (MTTR) and keeping your systems running smoothly. Quick actions help you tackle those challenges with fast access to the New Relic app’s common functionality right on the home screen.

By default, quick actions displays up to four of your favorite entities. If you have more than four favorites, you’ll see the most recently used ones. If you haven't set up any favorites, the display shows actions linking to the most-used capabilities (APM, Alerts, Synthetics, Dashboards). 

To use this feature, simply long press the New Relic app icon on your home page to see your shortcuts. Here are some examples:

* Android

        <img
          style={{ maxWidth: '290px' }}
          title="A screenshot of some favorites on the home screen."
          alt="A screenshot of some favorites on the home screen."
          src={mobileAppsQuickActionAndroid}
        />

* iOS

        <img
          style={{ maxWidth: '290px' }}
          title="A screenshot of some favorites on the home screen."
          alt="A screenshot of some favorites on the home screen."
          src={mobileAppsQuickActioniOS}
        />
