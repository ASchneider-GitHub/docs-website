If you're using a containerized image for Lambda, you'll want to add New Relic to your code. After you add our pre-built layer to your image, you'll need to push the image to your AWS Elastic Container Registry. From there, whenever you run your function, New Relic will run, too. 

Here's a guide to adding our pre-built layer to your code. 

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add New Relic to your Dockerfile:
New Relic offers pre-built layers for different runtimes: Java, Node.js, and Python.

1. Select the layer compatible with your specific Lambda function's runtime and region:
 * [Java](https://gallery.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-java)
 * [Node.js](https://gallery.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-nodejs) 
 * [Python](https://gallery.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-python)
3. **At the top of your Dockerfile** add the following code:

 FROM public.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-java:17-arm64 AS layer

 # Layer code
 COPY --from=layer /opt/ /opt/
 ```
 </TabsPageItem>

 <TabsPageItem id="2`">
 ```
 FROM public.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-python:38-arm64 AS layer

 # Layer code
 COPY --from=layer /opt/ /opt/
 ```
 </TabsPageItem>

 <TabsPageItem id="3`">
 ```
 FROM public.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2/newrelic-lambda-layers-nodejs:20-arm64 AS layer

 # Layer code
 COPY --from=layer /opt/ /opt/
 ```
 </TabsPageItem>

### Create an image
 1. After you add the New Relic pre-built layer to your Dockerfile, you will need to build a new image from the Dockerfile. This new image will have your original code _and_ New Relic's layer. To do this, we recommend following the steps listed in the AWS guide, [Pushing a Docker image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html).
 2. Push the built image to your AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository for deployment.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure your Lambda function
 1. Create a new Lambda function using the image you pushed to AWS ECR. For more information on how to create this function, we recommend reviewing the AWS guide: [Working with container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html).
 2. Configure the Lambda function with the same settings as your original function, but ensure you add any required environment variables for New Relic integration.
 3. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in `cmd` override for your function. You can do that using the instructions in these two docs:
        * [Instrument your own Lambda functions](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/instrument-your-own/)
        * [Layerless instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless)
