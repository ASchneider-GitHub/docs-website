After you've successfully linked your New Relic and AWS accounts, you can instrument your non-containerized Lambda function.

## Before you begin [#begin]

* [Link your New Relic and AWS accounts](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda#link)
* [Review our different instrumentation methods](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda#method)

## Instrumentation methods [#instrumentation]
Below we've listed some instrumentation methods for New Relic Lambda monitoring. The CLI, serverless framework, CloudFormation/SAM, and Terraform methods all include the New Relic layer, which means that whenever your function is invoked, the New Relic agent included in the layer will instrument the function. After the agent generates the instrumented payload, `NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING`, the New Relic Lambda extension will send that data to New Relic. 

Depending on your needs, you can choose to either bypass the extension and only see telemetry in CloudWatch, bypass CloudWatch, or use CloudWatch as a fallback. The end of this doc will guide you through each option.

### Instrument your Lambda function with the `newrelic-lambda` CLI quickstart [#quickstarts]

The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use
New Relic.

To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run:

```
newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id">YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID</a> --function my-function --upgrade
```

This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime.

This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process.

Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use `--function all`, `--function installed`, or
`--function not-installed` to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing
New Relic instrumentation.

    id="cloudformation"
    title="CloudFormation / SAM templates"
  >
AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction.

At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state.

Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a Node.js Lambda function:

    ```yaml
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
    Description: And example of a simple instrumented Node.js Lambda

    Resources:
      NewRelicExample:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step.
          CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/
          # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below.
          Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler
          Runtime: nodejs12.x
          Environment:
            Variables:
              # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value
              NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: YOUR_PATH_TO_INITIAL_LAMBDA_HANDLER
              # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID
              NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
              # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just
              # your account id.
              NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
          Layers:
            # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry,
            # as well as the New Relic agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy.
            - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34
          Policies:
            # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic license key. We need this so
            # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic
            - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy:
                SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN
    ```

    Conventionally, you'll have a file named `template.yaml` that describes your function, and its resources.

    id="serverless"
    title="Serverless Framework"
  >
Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in Node.js, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python, Ruby, Java, and .NET functions.

New Relic offers a [Serverless Framework Plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers) to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application.

### Install the plugin [#install]

First,

```bash
    npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
```

Or, alternatively,

```bash
    yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
```

Find your [New Relic Account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id), your [New Relic Personal API Key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key)

Then add the following to your `serverless.yaml` file:

```yaml
    plugins:
      - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
    custom:
      newRelic:
        accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here
        apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here
        linkedAccount: your-new-relic-integration-account-name-here
    ```

    Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as
    well as many other things. We offer
    [some examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/terraform) of New Relic
    instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts.

### AWS manual instrumentation [#console]

While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for Node.js, Python, Ruby and Java.

    1. Find the [layer](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/) that matches your runtime and region.
    2. Copy the _Amazon Resource Name_ (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function.
    3. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function:
        * Python and Ruby: `newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler` (underscores)
        * Node: `newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler` (hyphens)
        * Java:
            * `RequestHandler` implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest`
            * `RequestStreamHandlerWrapper` implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest`
    4. Add these environment variables to your Lambda console:
   * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id)
   * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER`: Path to your initial handler.
    5. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret
    6. Find the ARN of the secret named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
    7. . Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the `SECRET_ARN` with the value you found above):

```json
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
        ],
        "Resource": "SECRET_ARN",
        "Effect": "Allow"
      }
    ]
```

Note that for Go, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it.
Configuration changes are not enough.

## Instrument with the extension only [#extension-only]
Every agent layer also contains an Extension for sending logs and payloads to New Relic, bypassing CloudWatch. This can help reduce latency and costs as compared to CloudWatch. However, it comes at the risk of performance and reliability impacts to your function.

After adding a New Relic Lambda layer, the extension will be enabled and have log shipping disabled by default.

If you want to see function logs in New Relic, you’ll need to enable extension sending of function logs with an environment variable.

It’s important to note that function logs are just the logs recorded by the function during its invocation.
The extension will not send Lambda runtime logs like START, END, and REPORT lines.

### Instrument with CloudWatch only [#cloudwatch-telemetry]

As [mentioned previously](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/architecture#cloudwatch)
we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated.

1. Disable the extension by adding the `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED` environment variable to your function,
   with the value `false`.
2. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function with the logs for your
   function.
   * The CLI can do this for you: `newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function FUNCTION_NAME`
   * Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to
     invoke the `newrelic-log-ingestion` lambda function. See below.

## Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda

    1. Open CloudWatch and select <DNT>**Logs**</DNT> in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring.
    2. Select <DNT>**Actions > Subscription filters > Create Lambda subscription filter**</DNT>.
    3. Under <DNT>**Lambda function**</DNT>, select the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
    4. Set the <DNT>**Log format**</DNT> to `JSON`.
    5. Set the <DNT>**Subscription filter pattern to**</DNT> `?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?"Task timed out" ?RequestId`. Alternatively, if you are using the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable [stream all your logs](#stream-all-logs) to our Logs, leave this field blank.

       See [notes and caveats about this procedure](#stream-logs).

       <Callout variant="important">
         Make sure the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function.
       </Callout>
