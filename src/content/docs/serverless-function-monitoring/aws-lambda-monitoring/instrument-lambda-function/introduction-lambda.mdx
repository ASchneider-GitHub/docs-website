As companies transition towards FaaS architecture, it's important to understand what's happening within your function each time it's invoked. After you instrument New Relic with your function, each time your function runs, New Relic does too. You will be able to see performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. 

This doc will explain New Relic's Lambda monitoring architecture and walk you through linking your AWS and New Relic accounts. You will need to link your accounts before you instrument your functions. 

## How the Lambda instrumentation works [#how]

These are the essential elements of AWS Lambda instrumentation with New Relic:

* **Your function**: Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked.
* **The New Relic Agent or SDK**: Depending on the language your function is written in, New Relic provides different agents or SDK's. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. 
* **The New Relic Lambda extension**: When you instrument the New Relic Lambda extension in your function, it will run inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects and sends it to New Relic's backend in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. You don't need the Lambda extension to monitor your function with New Relic. 

## Choose your instrumentation method [#method]

There are three ways to ship your New Relic AWS Lambda telemetry. Which shipping method you choose depends on your data needs.

    alt="A screenshot depicting the different shipping methods for Lambda"
    src={serverlessShippingMethods}
/>

    * **Cost**: The most cost-effective way to instrument with AWS Lambda is by using any of our layers, which include the Lambda extension. By default, our extension never sends data to AWS CloudWatch. 
    * **Reliability**: You can ship telemetry only through CloudWatch. To do this, you will disable the New Relic Lambda extension. This means that your Lambda function will be lighter and won't have any additional processes to run when its invoked. In this case, logs and payloads will be shipped to New Relic through CloudWatch and not through the extension. 
    * **Best of both worlds**: Using the extension with AWS CloudWatch as a fallback provides helps keep costs down while providing a fail-safe in case there is a problem with the extension. 

We will show you to instrument using each method in our instrumentation docs:
    * [Instrument your containerized Lambda function]
    * [Instrument your non-containerized Lambda function]
    * [Instrument your layerless Lambda function]

## Before you begin [#begin]

Before enabling serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you'll need:

1.  A New Relic account with either an admin role or have the **Infrastructure manager**[add-on role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#add-on).
2.  A <InlinePopover type="userKey" />.
3.  An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets.

Then you'll need to complete the following:

1. Install[AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) configure using `aws configure`. You will need an AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key.
2.  Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.3 or higher. 
3.  Install the [newrelic-lambda CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation). To install, run the following:
    ```brew
        pip3 install newrelic-lambda-cli
    ```
4. By default, we use the AWS Managed Policy `ReadOnlyAccess`. This allows the Infrastructure integration to see
all the resources in your account, rather than just your Lambda functions and CloudWatch metrics. New Relic
recommends this default, but we understand that some organizations prefer a strict security posture for
third party integrations. If you'd like to limit New Relic's access, the IAM role can be granted with a minimum of these permissions: 

```yaml
    Resource: "*"
    Action:
    - "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
    - "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
    - "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
    - "lambda:GetAccountSettings"
    - "lambda:ListFunctions"
    - "lambda:ListAliases"
    - "lambda:ListTags"
    - "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings"
```
5. Before running the CLI, you will need to grant New Relic a minimum of these permissions in AWS:   

```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "CLIAccessPolicy",
                "Action": [
                    "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
                    "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                    "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
                    "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                    "iam:CreateRole",
                    "iam:GetRole",
                    "iam:PassRole",
                    "lambda:AddPermission",
                    "lambda:CreateFunction",
                    "lambda:GetFunction",
                    "logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter",
                    "logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters",
                    "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet",
                    "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
                "Sid": "NRLogAccessPolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate",
                    "serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion"
            }
        ]
    }
```

If you'd like to learn more about our CLI, see [our CLI repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation).

## Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes [#recommended]

We recommend the following runtimes:

* Node.js: `nodejs16.x`, `nodejs18.x`, `nodejs20.x`
* Python: `python3.8`, `python3.9`, `python3.10`, `python3.11`, `python3.12`
* Go: `provided.al2`
* Java: `java8.al2`, `java11`, `java17`
* Ruby: `ruby3.2`, `ruby3.3`
* .NET: `dotnet6`, `dotnet8`

## Consider costs [#costs]

Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges.Our [`newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function](/docs/install-enable-new-relics-monitoring-aws-lambda#manual-nr-lambda), which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a [Third Party Service](/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy): AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

If you use the [Lambda Extension](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension), you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.

## Link your AWS and New Relic accounts [#link]

Before you can instrument your function, you will need to link your AWS account to New Relic. By linking accounts, you are granting New Relic permission to create an inventory of your AWS account and automatically gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. After you've linked accounts, resources in your AWS account will appear as entities in the entity explorer.

<Steps>
<Step>
## Instrument New Relic's Lambda layer with the `newrelic-lambda` CLI

To instrument New Relic's Lambda layer, run: 

```bash
newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID
--nr-api-key YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY
```

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI adds your New Relic as a secret in [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) for greater security.
</Step>

<Step>
## Install Metric Streams [#metric-streams]

For New Relic to monitor your Lambda function, you will need to install either [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) or [API Polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring). We recommend using Metric Streams but you can let also let the CLI automatically install the API Polling integration for you. 

If you'd like to use Metric Streams, install that now before running the CLI. You can install that using our [Connect AWS integrations using Metric Streams](docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) documentation. 

</Step>

<Step>
## Environment variables [#environment]

When you instrument New Relic's Lambda layer with the CLI your environment variables with be configured automatically. You may want to change some of the default settings and configure your Lambda functions with the environment variables that match your monitoring needs. Choose your runtime to see the available environment variables and our recommendations for default settings.

## Try our example functions

After you've instrumented New Relic's Lambda layer, we strongly recommend trying out our example functions. Our minimal working examples should be used as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions. Use these examples to become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and reference them for your own instrumentation.

While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples.

Each of our basic examples demonstrate:

* Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function
* Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />
* Runtime-specific techniques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry
* Managing function log retention in CloudWatch
* Forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda extension
* Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda extension
* Adding custom attributes to the invocation event
* Adding custom events to the telemetry

Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension). There's one for each Lambda runtime New Relic supports:

* [Node.js](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/node)
* [Python](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/python)
* [Go](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/go)
* [Java](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/java)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/ruby)
* [.NET](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/dotnet)


You can also learn how to instrument distributed tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our
[distributed tracing example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/sam/distributedtracing). It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python, Ruby and Java functions.

<Callout variant="tip">
    As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown).

    In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

If you run into issues instrumenting your Lambda function, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="no-secrets"
    title="Cannot use AWS secrets manager"
>
If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension will accept a `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. Add the `--disable-license-key-secret` flag from the `newrelic-lambda integrations install` command. Then set this environment variable to your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> in your Lambda function configuration.

</Collapser>

<Collapser
    id="multiple"
    title="Multiple AWS regions and accounts"
>

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI should be run once per region, with the `--aws-region` parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret needs to be created in each region.

Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The `--aws-profile` argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI.

</Collapser>

<Collapser
    id="not-instrumented"
    title="Lambda function not showing as instrumented "
>

You've instrumented your Lambda function but it is not showing as instrumented in the <DNT>**Amazon Web Services -> Lambda functions**</DNT> section of New Relic.

You've linked both an [API polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/) and [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) integration to your New Relic account manually in the UI.

In this scenario with two integrations for the same AWS account in one New Relic account, a race condition will occur when instrumented payloads are received from the instrumented Lambda function at the New Relic [cloud-collector endpoint](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/blob/54ccfd44765feb4b3da77ae606323c18d9db7593/telemetry/client.go#L18-L19). The payload will be randomly assigned to one of the two integrations. If assigned to the integration not linked to your function entity, the payload will be dropped and the function will not show as instrumented. Only functions that have received at least one payload in the last 30 days to the `AwsLambdaInvocation` event will show as instrumented.

    ```sql
            FROM AwsLambdaInvocation 
            SELECT count (*)
            SINCE 30 days ago 
            WHERE entityGuid = 'ENTITY_GUID' 
            LIMIT 1
    ```

To prevent creating two integrations for the same AWS account, we recommend you use the `newrelic-lambda` CLI, as mentioned above, because it will detect an existing integration and use it.

If two integrations have already been created, choose one to keep and unlink the other by clicking <DNT>**Unlink this account**</DNT> at <DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
  There are some [limitations to Metric Streams integrations](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/#integrations-not-replaced-streams) that should be considered before unlinking an API polling integration. There are also some [limitations to Infrastructure Dimensional metrics queries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql/#known-limitations) which should be considered before fully committing to a Metric Streams integration.
</Callout>

<Collapser
    id="fail-retrieve-license"
    title="Failure to retrieve license key `AccessDeniedException`  "
>
Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. In our examples, check out the `template.yaml` file to see an easy way to grant this permission.

    ```bash
        Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN>
    ```
