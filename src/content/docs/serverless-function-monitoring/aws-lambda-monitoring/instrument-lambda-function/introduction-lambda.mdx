As your organization transitions to a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) architecture with AWS Lambda, understanding and optimizing function performance becomes critical for ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.  Each Lambda invocation represents a potential bottleneck or opportunity for improvement.

New Relic's instrumentation for AWS Lambda provides deep visibility into the inner workings of your functions. By adding the New Relic agent to your function, each time your function is invoked, New Relic is too. You can gain insights into key performance metrics such as duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks.

This doc explains New Relic's Lambda monitoring architecture and walks you through linking your AWS and New Relic accounts. You must link your accounts before you can instrument your functions.

## How the Lambda instrumentation works [#how]

These are the essential elements of AWS Lambda instrumentation with New Relic:

* **Your function**: Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked.

* **The New Relic agent or SDK**: Depending on the language your function is written in, New Relic provides different agents or SDKs. Their job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function.

* **The New Relic Lambda extension**: When you instrument the New Relic Lambda extension in your function, it will run inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects and sends it to New Relic's backend in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. You don't need the Lambda extension to monitor your function with New Relic.

## Choose your shipping method [#method]

There are three ways to ship your New Relic AWS Lambda telemetry. Which shipping method you choose depends on your data needs.

* **Cost**: The most cost-effective way to instrument with AWS Lambda is by using any of our layers, which include the Lambda extension. By default, our extension never sends data to AWS CloudWatch.

* **Reliability**: You can ship your data through CloudWatch only. To do this, you will disable the New Relic Lambda extension. This means that your Lambda function will be lighter and won't have any additional processes running when it's invoked. In this case, logs and payloads will be sent to New Relic through CloudWatch instead of the extension.

* **Best of both worlds**: Using the extension with AWS CloudWatch as a fallback helps keep costs down while providing a fail-safe in case there is a problem with the extension.

We will show you to instrument your Lambda function using each method in our instrumentation docs:

    * [Containerized instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/containerized-images/)

    * [Layered instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/instrument-your-own/)

    * [SDK based instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless/)

## Consider costs [#costs]

Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a [Third Party Service](/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy): AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

If you use our [newrelic-lambda-extension](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension) bundled in our [New Relic Lambda Layers](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-layers), you can avoid sending logs and telemetry via CloudWatch and the [newrelic-log-ingestion](https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion) function. It's also possible to configure the [newrelic-log-ingestion](https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion) function as a [CloudWatch fallback](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/cloud-watch-fallback/) method for functions that require high availability of observability data.
