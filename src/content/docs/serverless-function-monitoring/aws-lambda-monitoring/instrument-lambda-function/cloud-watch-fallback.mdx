You can ship New Relic Lambda monitoring data in a few different ways depending on your needs. The option that provides the strongest performance of your function and the strongest fail-safe includes configuring CloudWatch as a fallback. This means that you will ship telemetry to New Relic through the extension and, if there's a problem with the extension, New Relic will still receive payloads through CloudWatch.

Benefits of the CloudWatch fallback:

* **Independent execution**: Captures all logs from CloudWatch independently of your function's execution. It is very unlikely to interfere with your function's normal operation, or impact the invocation duration of your function.
* **Works with secured networks**: Useful for functions in a VPC that can't have outbound traffic to New Relic.
* **Enables enhanced monitoring**:  Needed for other forms of infra and database telemetry. To learn more, see our [Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring integration docmentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-rds-enhanced-monitoring-integration/).

While this shipping option offers the strongest fail-safe, it's important to note that the AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data. Keep data ingest in mind when thinking about costs and which New Relic pricing plan you choose. 

## Implementation options [#fallback]

There are three ways you can implement a CloudWatch fallback:

    1. **Enable the extension for telemetry payloads and disable the extension for logs**: In this scenario, telemetry payloads are shipped through the extension and logs and payloads through CloudWatch in the event the extension fails.
    2. **Extension enabled for payloads and logs**: In this scenario, payloads and logs are shipped through the extension and payloads through CloudWatch in the event the extension fails. 
    3. **Extension disabled**: In this scenario, CloudWatch is always used to send logs and payloads.

If the Extension fails to start up, otherwise known as noop mode, or crashes, it will fail to encode the `NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING` line generated by our agents. The `NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING` line will appear in CloudWatch logs instead. If the `aws-log-ingestion` function is installed in the same region as your function, configured to ship payloads, and is triggered by your function's CloudWatch log group, then it can act as a fallback to the extension for shipping payloads.

## Before you begin  [#requirements]

Before you set up a fallback option you will need to complete the following:

    * Install the `aws-log-ingestion` function from AWS region where you want to send your logs from.
    * If sending logs, create a filter pattern equal to null, or create a custom pattern to match the function logs you want to send. New Relic will receive the CloudWatch logs for your function. To avoid duplicate logs, the extension needs to have its log shipping disabled. The extension's log shipping is disabled by default.

Here are some best practices before updating your New Relic Lambda layer:

    * Before you update to a newer layer version, keep in mind that the latest layer might introduce changes that break the extension or a third party dependency.
    * Pin a layer version that is known to work well for your function and only update to a newer layer version as needed to resolve bugs, obtain new features and security patches, or because an agent has EOL'd.
    * Carefully review all changes and release notes and test in a dev or staging environment before deploying a new layer to production.

## Payload fallback with optional CloudWatch logs [#one]

If you don't send logs to CloudWatch, this option is the least expensive and most robust way to ensure that instrumented payloads always make it to New Relic. If you're sending logs, this option will introduce some CloudWatch costs for log shipment. See [Data ingest: Billing and rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/) for more info about pricing.

### Configuration [#configuration-one]

After you add a New Relic Lambda layer, the extension is enabled and has log shipping disabled by default.

1. Set [extension environment variables](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/blob/main/config/config.go) on your function:

    * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED`: true (default)
    * `NEW_RELIC_EXTENSION_SEND_FUNCTION_LOGS`: false (default)

2. Set your `aws-log-ingestion` function environment variables:

    * `INFRA_ENABLED`: true
    * `LOGGING_ENABLED`: true (if sending logs)

If you're using [`serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers`](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers), set:

    ```yaml
    custom:
        newRelic:
            enableExtension: true
            enableFunctionLogs: false
            enableIntegration: true
            cloudWatchFilter: "*"
    ```

If you're using the [`newrelic-lambda-cli`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli), set:

    * `newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> --nr-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY> --enable-logs`
    * `newrelic-lambda layers install --function <name or arn> --nr-account-id <YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID>`
    * `newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function &lt;name or arn> --filter-pattern ""`

## Payload fallback with optional extension logs [#two]

This option provides the lowest cost path that ensures instrumented payloads always make it to New Relic. This option ships function logs through the New Relic Lambda extension, so if the extension fails to start up or crashes, function logs will be missing from New Relic.

If you're sending function logs, make sure the extension is configured to do so. These logs will only be sent by the extension and there will not be a CloudWatch fallback for logs in order to avoid duplicates.

### Configuration [#configuration-two]

After adding a New Relic Lambda layer, the extension is enabled and has log shipping disabled by default. If you want to see function logs in New Relic, you'll need to enable extension sending of function logs with an environment variable.

It's important to note that function logs are just that, logs that are recorded by the function during its invocation. The extension will not send Lambda runtime logs like `START`, `END`, and `REPORT` lines.

Set [extension environment variables](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/blob/main/config/config.go) on your function:

    * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED`: true (default)
    * `NEW_RELIC_EXTENSION_SEND_FUNCTION_LOGS`: true

Set your `aws-log-ingestion` function environment variables:

    * `INFRA_ENABLED`: true
    * `LOGGING_ENABLED`: false (disable log forwarding to avoid duplicates or set the CloudWatch subscription filter pattern to match `NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING` lines only)

If you're using [`serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers`](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers), set:

    ```yaml
    custom:
        newRelic:
            enableExtension: true
            enableFunctionLogs: true
            enableIntegration: true
            cloudWatchFilter: "NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING" (only send payloads)
    ```

If you're using the [`newrelic-lambda-cli`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli), set: 

    * `newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> --nr-api-key <YOUR_API_KEY>`
    * `newrelic-lambda layers install --function &lt;name or arn> --nr-account-id &lt;YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID>`
    * `newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function &lt;name or arn> --filter-pattern "NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING"`


## Always send logs and payloads via CloudWatch [#three]

This option relies completely on CloudWatch and our `aws-log-ingestion` function to ship logs and payloads to New Relic. This option has the extension disabled to avoid potential downtime caused by extension failures.

For this method, the New Relic Lambda extension needs to be disabled completely to avoid encoding the `NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING` line. With the New Relic Lambda extension disabled, all telemetry will go out via CloudWatch + subscription filter + aws-log-ingestion function.

### Configuration [#configuration-3]

After adding a New Relic Lambda layer, the extension is enabled and has log shipping disabled by default. You'll need to disable the extension with an environment variable.

Set [extension environment variables](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/blob/main/config/config.go) on your function as follows:

    * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED`: false

Set your `aws-log-ingestion` function environment variables as follows:

    * `INFRA_ENABLED`: true
    * `LOGGING_ENABLED`: true

If you're using [`serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers`](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers), set:

    ```yaml
    custom:
    newRelic:
        enableExtension: false
        enableIntegration: true
        cloudWatchFilter: "*"
    ```

If you're using the [`newrelic-lambda-cli`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli), set: 

    * `newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id &lt;YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> --nr-api-key &lt;YOUR_API_KEY>`
    * `newrelic-lambda layers install --function &lt;name or arn> --nr-account-id &lt;YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID> --disable-extension`
    * `newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function &lt;name or arn> --filter-pattern ""`
