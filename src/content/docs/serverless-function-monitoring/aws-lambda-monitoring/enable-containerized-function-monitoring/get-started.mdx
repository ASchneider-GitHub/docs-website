Containerized Lambda functions offer an alternative way to deploy code within AWS Lambda while still enjoying the benefits of serverless computing. 

With New Relic, you can monitor AWS Lambda functions deployed using containerized images, so that you can: 

* **Increase flexibility**: Use familiar container tooling and leverage pre-built images for your code and dependencies.
* **Improve security**: Benefit from container isolation and potential security advantages associated with containerized environments.
* **Ensure consistent runtime**: Ensure a consistent development, testing, and deployment environment.
