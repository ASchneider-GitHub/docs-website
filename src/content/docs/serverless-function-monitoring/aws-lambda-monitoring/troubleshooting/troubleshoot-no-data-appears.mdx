## Problem

After generating traffic for your AWS Lambda function and waiting five minutes, none of your function data appears in the New Relic UI.  There are no errors in the logs and no NRIntegrationErrors or NRIntegrationWarnings in the New Relic UI.

## Solution

The most common reason for no data appearing with no errors is that the [license key and account ID](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/) are from different accounts.  In the case of a mismatch, the [New Relic Lambda extension](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension) or [lambda that processes cloud watch logs](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) will report the data successfully, but the data will be silently dropped since the account ID doesn't match.  This results in no errors or warnings.

To resolve this issue, make sure that the license key and account ID are from the same account.  Using the [New Relic Lambda CLI](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/#rec) to enable serverless monitoring is recommended to minimize these types of issues.  The license key can be updated in the AWS Secrets Manager.  For the account ID and for configurations not use the AWS Secrets Manager, the [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/#env-var) can be updated with the correct license key or account ID to correct the problem.

Additional troubleshooting information can be found [here](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/#troubleshooting).
