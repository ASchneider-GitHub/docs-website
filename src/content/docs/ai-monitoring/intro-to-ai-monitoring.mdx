When New Relic talks about AI, we're referring to the layer of your environment that has a large language model (LLM) at its center. Your front-end service may contain your AI assistant, but underneath this app are new APIs, databases, libraries, orchestration processes, and additional services. 

Your AI-powered app introduces new technologies into your environment that are hard to monitor, let alone understand. With AI Monitoring, you can bridge unfamiliar technologies to familiar solutions, deepening your knowledge about your AI's behavior so you can improve its performance.

## What is AI Monitoring? [#what-is]

AI Monitoring directs our APM agents to collect data about payloads delivered to and from supported AI providers. In this context, a payload encompasses instructions that control your AI's behavior, input and output data, and metadata. When processed by our agents, you can create a full story about how your AI processes perform. When you enable AI Monitoring with an APM agent, you can:

* **Evaluate errors and bugs in your code.** Get total insight over how your AI processes perform and make improvements when they fail. 
* **View feedback from your end user.** AI Monitoring correlates prompts, AI responses, and user feedback with transaction ids so you can see where your AI assistant breaks down. 
* **Track token usage.** See when your AI app usage spikes based on token usage, and use this information optimize your app to keep costs down. 
* **Compare models.** CONTENT HERE WHEN AVAILABLE.

## Compatibility [#compatibility]

AI Monitoring supports some language agents and some frameworks or libraries. Refer to the below table to determine if your AI-powered app is compatible with AI Monitoring.

For example: 

* Our Python agent supports instrumentation for Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, and LangChain libraries.
* Our Java agent supports instrumentation for Amazon Bedrock, but not OpenAI or LangChain. 
* If your AI-powered app makes calls to other providers not listed here, then AI Monitoring won't capture data about your app.
