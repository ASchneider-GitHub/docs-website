<Steps>
    <Step>
## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

To use the OCSF integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with OCSF-specific data.
    </Step>
    <Step>

## Enable the OCSF integration with nri-flex

To set up the OCSF integration, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `nri-ocsf.yml` in the integrations directory:

  ```shell
  touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-ocsf.yml
  ```

2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-ocsf.yml` file to enable the agent to capture OCSF data:
  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      config:
        name: ocsfExample
        global:
          base_url: http://ip-address:PORT
          headers:
            accept: application/json
        apis:
          - event_type: ocsfSampleEvent       # use this name to query the data
            url: /customEndpoint               # endpoint with OCSF data
          - event_type: ocsfCustomEvent1      
            url: /customEndpoint2
  ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Restart your infrastructure agent:

  ```shell
  sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
  ```

In a couple of minutes, your application will begin sending metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).        
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Find your data 

You can use our pre-built dashboard template to monitor your OCSF application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > + Integrations & Agents**.
2. Click on the **Dashboards** tab.
3. In the search bar, type `OCSF`
4. The OCSF dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it

To instrument the OCSF quickstart and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [OCSF quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/ocsf) by clicking on the `Install now` button.

Here is an example NRQL query to view the OCSF master uptime:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ocsfSampleEvent
``` 
    </Step>
</Steps>
