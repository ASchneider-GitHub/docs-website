Integrating Cacti with New Relic enhances your capability to monitor, visualize, and optimize the performance of network elements and systems. This integration offers robust real-time metrics, monitoring capabilities, and alerting features, empowering you to guarantee the reliability and efficiency of your network infrastructure and applications. Through this integration, you gain a user-friendly graphical representation of your network metrics and system health data, all within a unified platform on New Relic.

## Set up the Cacti integration
Complete the following steps to set up the Cacti integration:

<Steps>
    <Step>
## Install the infrastructure agent

To use the Cacti integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Cacti specific data.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Expose Cacti metrics [#Expose]
By following below steps, you can expose the RRD data into either a CSV or JSON format:
1. Export data from Cacti's RRD files into the `XML format` using RRDTool.
2. Convert the XML data into either a `CSV or JSON` format.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Use NRI-Flex to capture CSV format metrics

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. You need to configure NRI-Flex for cacti and create a flex configuration file. Follow these steps:
1. Create a file named `cacti-config.yml` in the `/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` path.

2. Update the `cacti-config.yml` with the following configuration example:

    ```yml
    ---
    integrations:
      - name: nri-flex
        config:
        name: machineLoad
        apis:
          - name: machineLoad
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_load_1min_2.csv
          - name: memSwap
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_mem_swap_5.csv
          - name: proc
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_proc_1.csv
          - name: machineUser
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_users_3.csv
          - name: memBuffers
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_mem_buffers_4.csv
          - name: ApacheCpuLoad
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_apache_cpuload_6.csv
          - name: ApacheTotalHits
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_apache_total_hits_7.csv
          - name: ApacheTotalKbytes
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_apache_total_kbytes_8.csv
          - name: UserLogins
            file: /home/ubuntu/xmlToCsv/local_linux_machine_active_10.csv
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Forward Cacti logs
Follow these steps to forward Cacti logs to New Relic:

1. Edit the log file named `logging.yml` located at the following path:

  ```shell
  cd /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d
  ```

2. Add the following snippet to the `logging.yml` file. Replace `file` with your Cacti log file path if needed:

  ```yml
  logs:
    - name: cacti.log
      file: /var/www/html/cacti/log/LOG_FILE_NAME
      attributes:
        logtype: cacti_log
  ``` 
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Restart your infrastructure agent:

  ```shell
  sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
  ```

In a couple of minutes, your application will begin sending metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Find your data 

You can use our pre-built dashboard template to monitor your Cacti application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DoNotTranslate>**+ Add data**</DoNotTranslate> page
2. Click on <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>
3. In the search bar, type `Cacti`
4. The Cacti dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it

Your Cacti dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is an example NRQL query to view the count of the user login  :

```sql
SELECT latest(value) FROM UserLoginsSample FACET name
```        
    </Step>
</Steps>
