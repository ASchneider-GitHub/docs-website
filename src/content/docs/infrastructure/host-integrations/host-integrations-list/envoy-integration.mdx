Our Envoy integration meticulously monitors the operational efficiency of your Envoy applications, ensuring optimal performance and fine-tuning of Envoy clusters.

After setting up our Envoy integration, we give you a dashboard for your Envoy metrics.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways:  

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

## Configure NRI-Prometheus for Envoy [#configure]

1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in this path:
```shell
 cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
 ```
2. Add a snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file that enables the agent to capture Envoy data. Your configuration file should match our snippet in the [nri-prometheus](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) repository:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true 
      standalone: false

      # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
      emitters: infra-sdk

      # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

      targets:
        - description: Envoy metrics list
          urls: ["http://<ip-address>:9901/stats/prometheus"]

      #     tls_config:
      #     ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      #     cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

      # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false
      verbose: false

      # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
      # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
      # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care
      audit: false

      # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
      # scrape_timeout: "30s"

      # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints
      scrape_duration: "5s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false
      insecure_skip_verify: true
    timeout: 10s
```

## Forward Envoy logs to New Relic

You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Envoy logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in this path:

```shell
cd /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d
```
After creating the log file, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
logs:
  - name: envoy.log
    file: /tmp/envoy.log
    attributes:
      logtype: envoy_logs
  - name: envoy-admin.log
    file: /tmp/admin_access.log
    attributes:
      logtype: envoy_admin_logs
``` 
Replace `file` in the above file with your envoy log file path if your log_path is different from this.

## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Restart your infrastructure agent. 

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```

In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).


## Find your data 

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Envoy` to monitor your Envoy application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DoNotTranslate>**+ Add data**</DoNotTranslate> page
2. Click on <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>
3. In the search bar, type `Envoy`
4. The Envoy dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it

Your Envoy dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is a NRQL query to check the Envoy downstream total connections:

```sql
SELECT latest(envoy_http_downstream_cx_total) as 'Downstream total connections' from Metric
```
