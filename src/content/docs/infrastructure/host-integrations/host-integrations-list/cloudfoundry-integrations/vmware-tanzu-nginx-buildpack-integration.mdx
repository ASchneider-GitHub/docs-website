This documentation describes the New Relic Nginx Integration Buildpack for VMware Tanzu and provides instructions on how to install the tile. The tile can bind New Relic infrastructure agent to Nginx servers so you can monitor them in a VMware Tanzu environment.

The New Relic Nginx Integration Buildpack for VMware Tanzu enables you to bind Nginx servers to New Relic infrastructure agent. This allows you to monitor the health and performance of these servers, analyze the data captured by infrastructure agent, and additionally correlate the captured agent data with VMware Tanzu infrastructure metrics and events collected by the [New Relic Firehose Nozzle](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/).

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

This product has been tested and is compatible with VMware Tanzu OpsManager version 3.0.22 , 3.0.23 and Tanzu Application Service 5.0 and 6.0.

New Relic Nginx Integration Buildpack VMware Tanzu requires the following:

* This builpack gets installed as multi-buildpacks in the app manifest, So, you need cf CLI v6.38 or later.
* This buildpack must be installed on top of nginx_buildpack.
* An active New Relic account with a license key. This is used to bind Nginx servers to New Relic infrastructure agent.

For general information about adding buildpacks to manifests, see [Pushing an Application with Multiple Buildpacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/use-multiple-buildpacks.html) in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

## Installation and Configuration

The New Relic Nginx Integration Buildpack for VMware Tanzu can be installed via the tile in Ops Manager. Alternatively, you can extract the `.Pivotal` file and install individual extension buildpacks using the cf Command Line Interface (CLI) command `cf create-buildpack`.

After you start monitoring your Nginx servers, you can set <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> based on any metrics that are collected by .NET agents using the New Relic alerting subsystem.

The Newic Nginx Integration Buildpack for VMware Tanzu installs one or more of the following buildpacks depending on the tile configuration (total of 2 extension buildpacks):

* New Relic Nginx Extension Buildpack for Nginx servers running on Ubuntu Jammy 1.* stacks. This extension buildpack is non-cached.
* New Relic Nginx Extension Cached Buildpack for Nginx servers running on Ubuntu Jammy 1.* in disconnected (isolated) VMware Tanzu deployments. This is for support of air-gapped environments where there is no access to the outside world.

 buildpacks use the multi-buildpack approach of Cloud Foundry and require either the standard .NET Core buildpack or HWC buildpack to be specified as the last buildpack in the buildpack chain, either in the app manifest or in the `cf push` command line.

<Callout variant="important">
  The cached version of this extension buildpack for both .NET Core and .NET Framework contains New Relic .NET Agents version `9.1.1`
</Callout>

I hope this updated documentation meets your requirements!
