This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the New Relic Extension on an Azure Arc Connected Machine using the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

- Azure CLI installed on your local machine.
- Azure Arc Connected Machine set up and registered in your Azure subscription.
- The necessary permissions to manage resources in the specified resource group.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

### 2. Run Azure CLI Commands

Execute the following commands in your terminal to install the New Relic Agent on your Azure Arc Connected Machine:

#### For Linux-based Machines:

```bash
az connectedmachine extension create \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --machine-name "your-machine-name" \
  --location "your-location" \
  --name NewRelicAgent \
  --publisher newrelic.infrastructure.extensions \
  --type newrelic-infra \
  --settings '{ "NR_LICENSE_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" }'
```

#### For Windows-based Machines:

```bash
az connectedmachine extension create \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --machine-name "your-machine-name" \
  --location "your-location" \
  --name NewRelicAgent \
  --publisher newrelic.infrastructure.extensions \
  --type newrelic-infra \
  --settings '{ "NR_LICENSE_KEY": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" }'
```
Replace placeholders like "your-resource-group," "your-machine-name," and "your-location" with your actual resource group, machine name, and location.

### 3. Verification
Verify that the installation was successful by checking the New Relic Agent status on your Azure Arc Connected Machine.
