Do you want to monitor hardware and kernel metrics for a Linux server? You can do this with the New Relic remote write integration and the Prometheus Node Exporter. When you combine these two programs with the Prometheus monitoring system, you can send data to New Relic where you can analyze it. 

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Our instructions here are based on the Prometheus guide [Monitoring Linux host metrics with the node exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/). We'll expand on those instructions with steps to help you send your data to New Relic.

Here's what you need to get started:

* Decide which Linux host you want to instrument. We'll show examples below for Linux servers in EC2, GCP, and Azure instances.
* Make sure you've installed the Prometheus monitoring system. If you haven't already, you can find download it from the [Prometheus site](https://prometheus.io/download/). 

## Download and start Node Exporter [#download-node-exporter] 

Complete the following:

1. Download and start Node Exporter with the commands below. Be sure to replace the `wget` URL with the latest from the Prometheus [downloads](https://prometheus.io/download#node_exporter) page:

    ```
    # Note that <VERSION>, <OS>, and <ARCH> are placeholders.
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v<VERSION>/node_exporter-<VERSION>.<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz
    tar xvfz node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz
    cd node_exporter-*.*-amd64
    ./node_exporter
    ```
2. Set Node Exporter to run in the background with the keyboard commands `CONTROL + z` and `bg`.

## Configurations [#configs]

Before you start Prometheus, you'll need to make some configuration changes.

### Modify the Prometheus configuration file [#config-file]

Locate your main `prometheus.yml` configuration file so you can insert a snippet that does two things:

* Identifies your `prometheus_server` as `NodeExporter`
* Provides your New Relic license key

You can use the `remote_write` snippet below for Prometheus v2.26 and higher. If you're using an older version, see our main [remote write instructions](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/#setup). 

* Make sure to replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your value. 
* Add this snippet under `global_config` in the configuration file at the same indentation level as the `global` section.

```
remote_write:
  - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=NodeExporter
    authorization:
      credentials: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

### Service discovery or static configuration [#svc-discovery-static-config]

You can configure targets statically via the `static_configs` parameter, or you can use dynamic discovery with one of the supported service-discovery mechanisms. You can configure service discovery for your AWS EC2 instances by supplying the `region`, `access_key`, `secret_key` and `port`. 

**Service discovery in EC2**

```
    # Service Discovery or static configs
    ec2_sd_configs:
      - region: <EC2_REGION>
        # The AWS API keys. If blank, the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
        # and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are used.
        access_key: <ACCESS_KEY>
        secret_key: <SECRET_KEY>
        # The port to scrape metrics from. If using the public IP address, this must
        # instead be specified in the relabeling rule.
        # By default node_exporter will expose metrics on 9100
        port: <PORT>
```

**Static configuration**

```
    # Service Discovery or static configs
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

### Host to APM relationship [#host-to-apm]

To enable relationship features in New Relic for your host and the applications they run, you need to include some additional configuration options. Relationships require attributes that are dropped by default in Prometheus. You can include them through the `relabel_configs` step in our config file.

```
# Relabel configs
relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_instance_id]
    target_label: instanceid
```

The `source_label` differs based on the provider you're using: 

* Azure: `__meta_azure_machine_id` 
* GCP: `__meta_gce_instance_id` 

You can find all the available meta attributes under the appropriate `sd_config` in the Prometheus [Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration) page.

Here are some examples:

[Azure](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#azure_sd_config)

```
- job_name: node
    azure_sd_config:
      # The subscription ID. Always required.
      subscription_id: <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_azure_machine_id]
        target_label: instanceid
```

[GCP](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#gce_sd_config)

```
- job_name: node
    gce_sd_config:
      # The GCP Project
      project: <PROJECT>
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_gce_instance_id]
        target_label: instanceid
```

## Start Prometheus [#prometheus-startup]

Now you can start the Prometheus scraper.

1. Execute the following:

    ```
    ./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yml
    ```
3. Set the scraper to run in the background with the keyboard commands `CONTROL + z` and `bg`. 
2. Go to the New Relic UI, and look for metric data with a `metricName` prefixed with `node_` in the account YOUR_API_KEY is for.
