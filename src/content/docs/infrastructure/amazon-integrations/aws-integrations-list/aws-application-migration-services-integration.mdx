1. Open Application Migration Services from your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mgn/home)
2. Open the desired Source server from the available list
3. Select the `Post-launch settings` tab
4. Select `Edit`, and add the `Install New Relic agent` action, and add in the expected variables 

## Monitoring [#monitor]

Once the setup is complete, your AWS application will be monitored through the New Relic infrastructure agent. 
You can find the data available in the New Relic applicaiton by opening `All Entites` and locating the instance under the `Hosts` entities.
