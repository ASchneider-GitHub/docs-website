You can now use the AWS [Application Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/what-is-application-migration-service.html) to install the New Relic agent on applications migrating into AWS.

## Setup [#setup]

To have AWS install the [New Relic Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux/), you'll need to create a post-launch template through the AWS console. Follow these steps:

1. From your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mgn/home), open <DNT>**Application Migration Services** </DNT>.
2. Open the desired source server from the available list.
3. Click the **Post-launch settings** tab.
4. Select **Edit > Install New Relic agent** and add your account ID and license key.

## Monitoring your data [#monitor-data]

Once the setup is complete, your AWS application will be monitored by the New Relic infrastructure agent. 
You can find the data available in the New Relic applicaiton by opening `All Entites` and locating the instance under the `Hosts` entities.
