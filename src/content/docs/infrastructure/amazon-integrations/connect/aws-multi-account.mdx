The New Relic UI gives you a complete view of your AWS system, making monitoring much easier. You can view all of your AWS accounts under a single account through our UI. You can collect metrics in a single AWS account and get tags from all your AWS accounts to enrich the metrics you're collecting. You can easily track performance metrics while reducing overall infrastructure costs, which means you'll save time and money.

Having a single view of all your AWS accounts helps you:

* Reduce the number of friction points by setting up a single observe account for AWS.

* Reduce overall infrastructure costs by reducing the number of streams sending metrics to observability solutions.

* Get tagged and metadata-enriched metrics from your AWS accounts.


## Before you start [#before-start]

Check the following:

* You've configured [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to send metrics to a single AWS account that must be connected to New Relic.

* You're using [AWS Resource Groups Tagging API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html) to collect tags.

* You're using AWS config to collect metadata.

* All IAM roles have access to fetch tags from individual accounts.

* You use the [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) used in the AWS observe account on all AWS accounts to monitor.

## Explore your AWS data [#explore-data]

To explore your AWS data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT>. Under the <DNT>**Integrations**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**AWS**</DNT>. Then, select your integration and click the <DNT>**Explore data**</DNT> link. This link opens the <DNT>[**Data explorer**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/)</DNT> to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions. You also have a tab to open the [query builder](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/).


## Check the status of your account [#account-status]

You can check the status of your account by clicking the <DNT>**See account status dashboard**</DNT> button.
