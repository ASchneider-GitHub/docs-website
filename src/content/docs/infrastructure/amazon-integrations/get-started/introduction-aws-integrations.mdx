New Relic offers several methods to collect performance data about your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Once you've connected New Relic with AWS, you get total visibility into AWS telemetry data, letting you closely monitor the health of your AWS stack. 

## Integrate New Relic with your AWS stack [#connect]

There are two primary options for monitoring your entire AWS cloud stack: Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams and our API polling integration.

### Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams [#Cloudwatch]

Our recommended solution is through Amazon [CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html). 

Follow our guide to [set up the Cloudwatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/cloudwatch-metric-streams/aws-metric-stream-setup) for New Relic.

For more information on why we use CloudWatch and the cost considerations, reference our [CloudWatch Metric Streams overview documentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/cloudwatch-metric-streams/aws-metric-stream/).

### AWS API Polling integration (Legacy) [#api-polling]

Some situations or stacks may arise where our API Polling Integration needs to be used instead of CloudWatch Metric Streams.

For example, these AWS services aren't currently supported by the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration:

* AWS CloudTrail
* AWS Health
* AWS Trusted Advisor
* AWS X-Ray
* [AWS VPC Flow Logs](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-vpc-flow-logs-monitoring-integration/)
* [AWS CloudFormation](https://github.com/newrelic/cloudformation-partner-integration)

Follow our guide to [set up API Polling for AWS services](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/cloudwatch-metric-streams/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/).

### Integrations and AWS costs [#cloudwatch-billing]

This section directs you to relevant AWS docs that explain how our integrations affect your AWS billing. 

* The [AWS CloudWatch Pricing page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html)defines AWS CloudWatch metric streams pricing based on the number of metric updates.
* We sometimes use AWS Kinesis Data Firehose as the delivery method from AWS to New Relic, so we recommend reviewing the [AWS Firehose pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/pricing/).
* When you enable AWS Config to enrich CloudWatch metrics with resource metadata, you're charged based on the number of configuration items recorded. See the [AWS Config pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/) for details.
* [AWS Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html) enriches metrics with custom tags defined in the associated AWS resources. This affects both polling and metric streams.

New Relic uses the Amazon CloudWatch API to obtain metrics from your AWS services when you use the API Polling integration instead of CloudWatch Metric Streams. Some situations may increase the number of calls to the CloudWatch API to exceed the <DNT>**1 million free**</DNT> limits granted by AWS and [increase your CloudWatch bill](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/troubleshooting/cloudwatch-billing-increase). This may happen when you: 

* Enable additional integrations through API Polling
* Add AWS resources to those integrations
* Scale those integrations across more regions.

AWS offers enhanced monitoring for some of their services that allows for more metrics at a higher frequency. You can check out [RDS enhanced monitoring costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.overview.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.cost) for more information.

## View your AWS data [#view-aws-data]

Once installed and configured, you can access data from your AWS services directly in the New Relic platform. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Amazon Web Services](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>. 

* To learn more about exploring your AWS data, check out our doc about [understanding and using data from infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/understand-use-data-infrastructure-integrations). 
* We also recommend [reviewing our doc specifically about AWS integration metrics](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/manage-aws-data/aws-integrations-metrics), too. 


## Region availability [#region-availability]

Most AWS services offer regional endpoints to reduce data latency between cloud resources and applications. New Relic can obtain monitoring data from services and endpoints that are located in all [AWS regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html), except China.
