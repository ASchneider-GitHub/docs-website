User actions in New Relic Browser provide insights into how users interact with your web app. You can see where users are clicking, scrolling, and interacting with your web app. Then, you can use this data to do the following:

* **Understand user behavior**: Identify the most used features and areas of your web app, and how users link actions together.
* **Improve the user experience**: Discover areas of your web app that are causing users frustration. For example, you might see that users are getting stuck on a particular page element or form field.
* **Identify issues in key user journeys**: Identify areas of your web app that are causing performance problems. For example, if key user actions are leading to errors, you'd prioritize fixing this critical user journey.

## How user actions work [#how-it-works]

When a user loads your web page, the New Relic Browser agent sets up event listeners for key interaction events. When those events are observed, user action events are generated and harvested to New Relic.

User actions currently encapsulate the following events:

* auxclick
* blur (window only)
* click
* copy
* focus (window only)
* keydown
* paste
* scrollend

User actions are sequentially aggregated, meaning that if multiple actions are performed in quick succession on the same DOM target, they are grouped together as a single user action. This helps you understand how users interact with your web app in a more meaningful way while keeping consumption costs low.

By default, browser event data is stored eight days, but actual data retention depends on your account.

For more details on user actions, see the [Data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/).

## View user actions [#view-events]

User actions are tracked by default for Pro and Pro+SPA agents. User actions are not available for the Lite browser agent. 

Do the following to see your user actions:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Confirm you're using the Pro or Pro+SPA agent:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser**</DNT>.
    2. Select your browser app.
    3. In the left-hand menu, click <DNT>**Application settings**</DNT>.
    4. On the **Application settings** page, make sure <DNT>**Pro**</DNT> or <DNT>**Pro + SPA**</DNT> browser agent is selected. 
  </Step>

    ### Query user actions in New Relic [#query-data]

    You can see user actions by querying the `UserAction` event type in [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/). Here's a query to show your data:

    ```sql
    FROM UserAction 
    SELECT *
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data consumption [#data-consumption]

User actions follow the same consumption pricing as your other browser bytes. The amount of bytes produced depends on the count, length, and user-activity levels of sessions.
