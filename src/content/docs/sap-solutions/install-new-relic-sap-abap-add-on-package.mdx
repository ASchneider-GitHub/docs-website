## Install SAP add-on file [#install-sap-add-on-file]

The ABAP component of NRM4SAP is packaged as a SAP add-on and can be installed using transaction <DNT>**SAINT**</DNT>. The following add-on installation must be performed on **client 000**:

    1. Login to **client 000**.
    2. Type the transaction code `SAINT` in the <DNT>**SAP GUI Command Field**</DNT> and press **Enter**.
    3. Go to <DNT>**Installation Package > Load Packages**</DNT>.
    4. Choose any method to load add-on files:
        - **SAR Archive from Frontend**: Copy the `.SAR` file to a folder on your local PC.
        - **SAR Archive from Application Server**: Ensure there is a download directory under the trans directory on the application server (`/usr/sap/trans/download`). Copy the add-on file to this directory.
        - **EPS Files from Application Server**: Untar the SAR file into the PAT file first. Execute the following command on the OS (Linux in this case):
  ```sql
  cd /usr/sap/trans
  cp /tmp/K-300AOIINNEWR.SAR /usr/sap/trans
  SAPCAR -xvf K-300AOIINNEWR.SAR
  ```
    5. In the popup, <DNT>**Do you want to upload OCS Packages from the EPS inbox?**</DNT>, select **Yes**.
  <Callout variant="tip">
    Ensure the OCS file is uploaded without errors.
  </Callout> 
    6. Click **Start** to begin the installation.
    7. Select the package and click **Continue**.
    8. When prompted with the question, **Do you want to add Modification Adjustment Transports to the queue?**, click **No**.
  <Callout variant="important">
    Only click Yes if adjustment transports are provided in the packaging list with instructions.
  </Callout> 
    9. Click the **Check** icon, to proceed to the next screen. Note that if the **Errors during Disassembling OCS Packages** page appears, click **Ignore**.
