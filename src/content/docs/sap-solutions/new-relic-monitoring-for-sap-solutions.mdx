## Overview [#overview]

New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions collects SAP telemetry data (Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces), transforms the data, and passes it to the New Relic One Platform for analysis and visualization.

## Central Monitoring System vs. Monitored Systems [#cms-vs-ms]

The SAP systems where the telemetry data are collected are called <DNT>**Monitored Systems**</DNT>. The SAP system, where NRM4SAP is installed to collect, transform, and transmit the telemetry data is called the <DNT>**Central System**</DNT>. Normally, <DNT>**NRM4SAP**</DNT> needs to be installed on only one SAP system, such as the <DNT>**SAP Solution Manager (SolMon)**</DNT>. It uses the standard SAP data provided such as **ST_PI**, **MTE**, and the **performance database**, so no additional agent needs to be installed on all the monitored systems.

## Data Flow Architecture [#data-flow-architecture]

SAP telemetry data is pulled into the Central System by RFC calls. It is then pushed to the ABAP Enterprise Connector and sent to New Relic One TDP Platform via HTTPS.

## Components to be installed [#components-to-installed]

Starting from version 3.0, **NRM4SAP** only needs the ABAP components, which are installed on the Central Monitoring System.

As part of the installation process, RFC destinations to the Monitored System are configured with the required authorization. Necessary configurations are also required to secure the HTTPS connection between **NRM4SAP** and **New Relic One** platform.
