<Callout variant="important">
    On October 22, 2024, we will [end of life](/whats-new/2024/04/whats-new-04-09-eol-synthetics-runtime-cpm) the containerized private minion (CPM) and the legacy synthetics runtime versions it supports. Please review our [recommended migration steps](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/#monitorMigration) to avoid degradation of your private location monitors. 
</Callout>

The synthetics job manager brings your synthetic monitors to [newest runtime](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime) for your private locations. The synthetics job manager will replace Containerized Private Minions (CPMs), and lets you monitor your private locations with simplified script creation, access to Chrome 100 and Node.js 16, and automated monitor management with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial). 

If you're ready to install the job manager, you can check out our [install doc](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) for installation procedures, or read through our [configuration doc](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration) for working with new or existing [private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations). 

## Version requirements [#requirements]

## Migrate from CPM to the job manager [#monitorMigration]

When you install the job manager, we recommend that you use the same private location key as your existing CPM. This simplifies the migration process. To migrate:

1. Retrieve your existing private location's key by [editing the private location](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics/private-location-list)
2. [Install job manager](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) using this key.
3. The [runtime upgrades UI](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/runtime-upgrade-ui/) will start testing the legacy runtime monitors assigned to this private location and populating test results. Running these tests and populating the UI may take a few hours. Use the UI to upgrade monitor runtimes. 
4. Once all legacy runtime monitors on the private location have been updated, you can uninstall your containerized private minion (CPM). 

Keep in mind that:

* CPMs execute monitors that use the legacy runtime
* Job managers execute monitors that use the newest runtime
* Ping monitors are load balanced, so both CPM and job managers can execute them

## Migrate synthetics running in Docker [#synthetics-docker]

If you're running more than one private location on a Docker container in the same host, you'll have port and other resource conflicts. To avoid this port conflict, make sure that you either:

* Run job managers and CPMs on different hosts.
* Run each job manager on a separate host.
* Run each CPM on a different host.

## Create a new private location  for job manager [#create-new]

If you want a fresh start, then you can [create a new private location](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations/#create-location) for the job manager. 

Creating a new private location prevents the runtime upgrades UI from proactively testing your legacy runtime monitors. This path would also require you to modify monitor configurations to use the new private location.

## Upgrade your monitors [#upgrade]

The job manager is not legacy runtime compatible and CPMs are not compatible with the newest runtime. CPMs, then, can't run scripted monitors that use Chrome 100+ or Node.js 16. If your job managers and CPMs are sharing a key, then your CPMs will handle any monitors on the legacy runtime, while the job manager will handle any monitors on the newest runtime.

    1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**</DoNotTranslate>, then select the monitor you want to edit.
    2. From the <DoNotTranslate>**Settings**</DoNotTranslate> tab, click <DoNotTranslate>**General**</DoNotTranslate>. 
    3. Switch to the newest runtime view via the dropdown menu. For scripted API monitors, choose Node.js 16. For scripted browser monitors, choose Chrome 100+.
    4. If using separate private locations for containerized private minions and synthetics job managers, update the location selection.
    5. Click <DoNotTranslate>**Validate**</DoNotTranslate> to check that your monitors function in the new runtime. Make any script modifications if needed.

## Smaller container images for your synthetics [#docker]

Job managers execute your synthetics from runtime-specific container images tailored to the jobs you want to execute. While CPMs bundled legacy runtimes and artifacts into one growing file, our job manager instead separates our Chrome, Node, and job management work into separate, smaller images.

With more control over job configuration for your private locations, job managers also let you: 

* Opt out of running a subset of runtime images if they are not required for their monitors.
* Update your runtime images (ping, API, and browser) independently of synthetics job manager updates.
* Configure and size your deployment how you want it.

## Simplified deployment with job managers [#deploy]

Unlike CPMs, which used file sharing to coordinate jobs in private locations, job managers [communicate via HTTP](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) with web services. This removes certain deployment requirements, such as specifying mounted volume in your docker configuration or persistent volumes in your Kubernetes configuration. 

By simplifying deployment, the job manager: 

* Reduces the possibility of permissions-related errors in high security environments.
* Reduces the risk of internal engine errors by no longer creating unique docker networks for non-ping monitor jobs.
* Gives better support at deployment for Kubernetes labels, annotations, node selectors, tolerations, and affinity across all components
