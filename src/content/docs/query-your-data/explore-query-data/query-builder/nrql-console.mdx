The NRQL console gives you a consistent option for querying your data anywhere in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** while keeping context of what you're doing. Whether you're monitoring your services, troubleshooting an issue, or just browsing your platform, with the query builder, you can explore your data to understand more about what you are seeing in just a click, without leaving your current view. Just click the bottom bar of any screen within New Relic to use the console and to begin querying your data!

The query builder has a host of useful features that make querying your data easier. You can:

* Use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through your recent queries, enabling you to keep track of your query history.
* Resize the query window using the arrow icon in the top right of the query builder window to focus more on the data you're querying.

We're adding more features to the query builder soon, so stay tuned for updates on this feature's functionality.
