## Why It Matters []

Researching the state of your systems, planning resources, identifying and responding to incidents, or troubleshooting faulty behaviors becomes straightforward with the Data Explorer. It allows you to identify, fetch, and visualize the data you're looking for through visual menus, bypassing the need for NRQL or query building.

Access all data stored in the New Relic Database (NRDB) quickly and intuitively with the Data Explorer. You can then facet your queries using attributes and filter down to the necessary value.

### What Metrics and Events Help You Do

- View data from different perspectives: from raw data to various visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, and more.
- Drill down into data using filters.
- Add your searches to a dashboard.
- Understand how NRQL works: the Data Explorer demonstrates how queries are constructed.

### Types of Data You Can Explore

In the context of Metrics and Events, "event" refers to all objects stored in the New Relic Database (NRDB). Metrics and Events allow you to explore:

- Dimensional metrics (the Metric data type).
- Events (the Event data type).
- Logs (the Log data type).

## Exploring Your Data

To access the Data Explorer, navigate to the bottom "Query your data" bar and click on the Data Explorer icon.
