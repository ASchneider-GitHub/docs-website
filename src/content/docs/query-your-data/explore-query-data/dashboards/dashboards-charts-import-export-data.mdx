You can use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) to visualalize and track your system's health, tackle issues, and plan any further steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders with various import and export options.

## Import dashboards

At the [dashboards index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started), you can **[import a dashboard as JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import)**.

## Export dashboards 

You can export the charts in any dashboard as either a comma-seperated file (CSV) or a PDF. 

<Tabs>
	<TabsBar>
        <TabsBarItem id="1">
            Export CSV
        </TabsBarItem>
        <TabsBarItem id="2">
            Export PDF
        </TabsBarItem>
    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="1">

From any chart in a dashboard, export charts as CSVs by clicking the dropdown in the top right of a chart and selecting **Export as CSV**. This will download your data as a CSV. 

While powerful, exporting as a CSV has limitations. A few things to keep in mind:

- Data always exports in UTC time (-7:00)
- Export doesn't support aggregator functions like `average()`
- Export doesn't support the `COMPARE_WITH` clause

        </TabsPageItem>
        <TabsPageItem id="2">

Export your dashboard as a pdf file by clicking the `...` button in the top right and selecting **Export dashboard as PDF**.

        </TabsPageItem>
    </TabsPages>
</Tabs>


## Share dashboards
From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard.
* Copy your dashboard **as JSON** and add it to the clipboard by clicking the `...` button in the top right and selecting **Copy JSON to clipboard**.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone).

## Share your charts, and other options [#charts-share]

For details about what you can do with the charts on your dashboards, see [Chart options](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#data-analysis).
