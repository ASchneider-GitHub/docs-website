You can use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) to visualalize and track your system's health, tackle issues, and plan any further steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders with various import and export options.

## Import dashboards [#import]

At the [dashboards index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started), you can **[import a dashboard as JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import)**.

## Export dashboards as a PDF [#export-dashboards-pdf]

Export your dashboard as a PDF file by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Export dashboard as PDF**.

    src={dashboardsExportPdf}
/>

## Export charts as a CSV [#export-charts-csv]

Export a table chart as a CSV file by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Export as CSV**.

/>

While powerful, exporting as a CSV has limitations. A few things to keep in mind:

* Data always exports in UTC time (-7:00)
* Export doesn't support aggregator functions like `average()`
* Export doesn't support the `COMPARE_WITH` clause

## Share dashboards [#share-dashboards]

From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard.
* Copy your dashboard **as JSON** and add it to the clipboard by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Copy JSON to clipboard**.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone).

## Add new content to a dashboard [#add-charts]

You can add new content in the form of [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) to any dashboard through the [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder) feature.

To add a chart to a dashboard:

* Click the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button at the top right corner, then create new content by clicking the **Add widget** button. Add a new chart using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or add text, images, or links using our [markdown editor](#markdown).
* Use the **+ Add to your dashboard** button.

From any chart, use the chart action menu on the upper right corner to **copy or duplicate** the chart.

## Export a table chart as CSV

You can export any table chart as a CSV file

## Troubleshooting chart errors [#troubleshoot-chart-errors]

When adding charts you may come across these error messages:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "400px" }}>
        **Error message**
      </th>

        The [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-timeseries) step size is larger than the selected time window. Modify the step and run the query again.
