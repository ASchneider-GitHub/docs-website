You can use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) to visualalize and track your system's health, tackle issues, and plan any further steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders with various import and export options.

## Import dashboards [#import]

At the [dashboards index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started), you can **[import a dashboard as JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import)**.

## Export dashboards as a PDF [#export-dashboards-pdf]

Export your dashboard as a PDF file by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Export dashboard as PDF**.

    src={dashboardsExportPdf}
/>

## Export charts as a CSV [#export-charts-csv]

Export a table chart as a CSV file by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Export as CSV**.

While powerful, exporting as a CSV has limitations. A few things to keep in mind:

* Data always exports in UTC time (-7:00)
* Export doesn't support aggregator functions like `average()`
* Export doesn't support the `COMPARE_WITH` clause

## Share dashboards [#share-dashboards]

From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard.
* Copy your dashboard **as JSON** and add it to the clipboard by clicking the **...** button in the top right and selecting **Copy JSON to clipboard**.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone).

## Query and explore with charts [#charts-share]

For details about what you can do with the charts, see [Querying and charting options](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#data-analysis).
