Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The New Relic Kubernetes monitoring integration gives you a quick and easy way to see what's going on with your Kubernetes clusters and workloads, whether they're hosted on-premises or in the cloud.

Once you've got the [Kubernetes integration up and running](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/), you can start monitoring all the services running on Kubernetes in one place with to our [cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer). It'll show you everything from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod, so you can get to the heart of how your cluster is performing.

## Why it matters [#features]

Managing Kubernetes can be tough. There's a lot going on all the time, with containers being created and deleted in minutes, apps crashing, and resources being used in unexpected ways. Our integration helps you figure out how to use Kubernetes in different ways, whether you're using it on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid setup.

Take a look at what you can do with New Relic:

* You can monitor the [Kubernetes control plane](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/configure-control-plane-monitoring) to manage and collect metrics from your clusters.

* You can [forward your Kubernetes logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/) to New Relic, which will give you more ways to manage your log data. You can collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

* You can build your own charts and [query](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) all your [Kubernetes data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/find-use-your-kubernetes-data) that our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you more insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers.

* You can [link your APM data to Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes) to measure how well your web and mobile apps are performing. You can track things like request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability.

* You can [monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes), like Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more. Check out our [tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/tutorial-monitor-redis-running-kubernetes).

* You can create alert [policies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) and [alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/alert-conditions/#create-alert-condition) based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the [predefined alert conditions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy).

* You can check out all your Kubernetes events. The [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration) watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. You can then visualize the event data in the cluster explorer. It's installed by default after [installing the New Relic Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/).

* Report data to Kubernetes that [triggers pod autoscaling](/docs/journey-demand/autoscale-your-infra) so you always have resources available when demand spikes, like during a peak demand event.

These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for [containerized processes running on instrumented hosts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes) and send in your own improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, check out the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/README.md) file.
