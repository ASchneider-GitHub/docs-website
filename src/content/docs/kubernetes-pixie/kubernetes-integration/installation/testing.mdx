<Callout title="PUBLIC PREVIEW">
    The K8s agent operator is in public preview.
</Callout>

The Kubernetes agent operator streamlines full-stack observability for Kubernetes environments by automating APM instrumentation alongside Kubernetes agent deployment. By enabling APM auto instrumentation, developers no longer need to manually manage [APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/). The Kubernetes agent operator will automatically installs, upgrades, and removes APM agents.

It currently [supports](#k8s-supported-versions) Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby with additional languages (PHP and Go) on the way.

## Before you begin [#before-begin]

Before installing the operator, check the following:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/): You must install it to use the charts. See the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) if you need help getting started.

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): You have to configure it to communicate with your cluster. 

- [Certificate manager](https://cert-manager.io/): You have to instal it in the cluster.


## Installation of the `cert-manager` dependency [#install-cert-manager]

To install the certificate manager dependency, run the following:

    ```shell
    helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
    helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
        --namespace cert-manager \
        --create-namespace \
        --set crds.enabled=true
    ```


## Installation of the Kubernetes agent operator [#install-k8s-operator]

Depending on what you need, you can choose to install the agent operator independently or together with our K8s integrations. We strongly recommend that you install it along with the K8s integration to take advantage of our full stack obsevability experience.

We strongly recommend to install it together with the Kubernetes integration to take advantage of our entire [full stack obsevability](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) experience.
