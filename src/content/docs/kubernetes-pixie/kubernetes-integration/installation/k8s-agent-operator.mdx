<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The Kubernetes agent operator streamlines full-stack observability for Kubernetes environments by automating APM instrumentation alongside Kubernetes agent deployment. By enabling APM auto instrumentation, developers no longer need to manually manage [APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/). The Kubernetes agent operator will automatically install, upgrade and remove APM agents.

It currently [supports](#k8s-supported-versions) Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby with additional languages (PHP and Go) on the way.
It has been tested on EKS and on-premise clusters running AMD nodes.

## Before you begin [#before-begin]

Before installing the operator, check the following:

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/): You must install it to use the charts. See the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) if you need help getting started.

* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): You have to configure it to communicate with your cluster.

## Installation of the Kubernetes agent operator [#install-k8s-operator]

Depending on what you need, you can choose to install the agent operator independently or together with our K8s integrations.

We strongly recommend to install it together with the Kubernetes integration to take advantage of our entire [full stack observability](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) experience.

### Bundle installation in addition to the Kubernetes integration (recommended) [#bundle-installation]

The Kubernetes agent operator chart is integrated as part of the [nri-bundle](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart, which manages the installation of all the components needed to enable a full Kubernetes observability.

Add the `k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true` parameter to your helm command or include it in a [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/nri-bundle/values.yaml) file.

See the [Install the Kubernetes integration](/install/kubernetes/?dropdown1=helm) page for more information about using Helm or check out the [nri-bundle](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart.

See this sample of Helm command using parameters:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com

helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
    --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY \
    --set global.cluster=CLUSTER_NAME \
    --namespace=newrelic \
    --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \
    --set global.lowDataMode=true \
    --set kube-state-metrics.enabled=true \
    --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \
    --set k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true \
    --create-namespace
```

### Standalone installation [#standalone-installation]

To install the Kubernetes agent operator with the default configuration, run these commands:

```shell
helm repo add k8s-agents-operator https://newrelic.github.io/k8s-agents-operator
helm upgrade --install k8s-agents-operator k8s-agents-operator/k8s-agents-operator \
    --namespace newrelic \
    --create-namespace \
    --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY
```

For a complete list of configuration options, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-agents-operator/tree/main/charts/k8s-agents-operator#values) chart.

## Monitored namespaces [#monitored-namespaces]

For each namespace you want the operator to be instrumented, a secret will be replicated from the newrelic operator namespace.
Inside the CRD YAML file, specify which APM agents you want to instrument. All available APM agent docker images and corresponding tags are listed on DockerHub:

    * [Java](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-java-init/general)
    * [Node](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-node-init/general)

      - name: NEW_RELIC_POD_NAME
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: metadata.name
    # Example overriding the appName configuration
      - name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME
        value: "$(NEW_RELIC_LABELS)-$(NEW_RELIC_POD_NAME)"
```

Targeting everything in a specific namespace with a label

```yaml
apiVersion: newrelic.com/v1alpha2
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: newrelic-instrumentation-lang
  namespace: newrelic

  #agent: ...
  namespaceLabelSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: "app.newrelic.instrumentation"
        operator: "In"
        values: ["java"]
```

Targeting a pod with a specific label

```yaml
apiVersion: newrelic.com/v1alpha2
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: newrelic-instrumentation-lang
  namespace: newrelic
spec:
  # agent: ...
  podLabelSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: "app.newrelic.instrumentation"
        operator: "In"
        values: ["dotnet"]
```

Using a secret with a non-default name

```yaml
apiVersion: newrelic.com/v1alpha2
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: newrelic-instrumentation-lang
  namespace: newrelic
spec:
  # agent: ...
  licenseKeySecret: the-name-of-the-custom-secret
```

In the example above, we show how you can configure the agent settings globally using environment variables. See each agent's configuration documentation for available configuration options:
* [Java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/)
* [Node](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/)
* [Python](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/)
* [.NET](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/)
* [Ruby](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/)

### cert-manager

The K8s Agents Operator supports the use of [`cert-manager`](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) if preferred.

Install the [`cert-manager`](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) Helm chart:
```shell
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set crds.enabled=true
```

In your `values.yaml` file, set `admissionWebhooks.autoGenerateCert.enabled: false` and `admissionWebhooks.certManager.enabled: true`. Then install the chart as normal.

## Available Chart Releases

To see the available charts:
```shell
helm search repo k8s-agents-operator
```

## Upgrade APM instrumentation in applications [#upgrade-apm-instrumention]

By default, the Kubernetes agent operator automatically installs the latest available versions of the corresponding [APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/).

Once an application is monitored, it's not automatically upgraded to a newer version unless the user chooses to upgrade. You can seamlessly upgrade the application to a newer version by simply redeploying the pods or restarting your deployment if the CR is already loaded inside the operator

## Remove APM instrumentation in applications [#remove-apm-instrumentation]

To remove the APM instrumentation in an application, you must remove the matching label selector inside either the podLabelSelector or namespaceLabelSelector used by the Kubernetes agent operator and then simply restart the deployment. In a few seconds, you will see that the APM agents have been automatically removed.

## Updating the Kubernetes agent operator [#upgrading-k8s-operator]

### Bundle installation

Run a upgrade of the nri-bundle chart with the following parameter:

```shell
k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true
```

### Standalone installation

Run the `helm upgrade` command to update to a newer version of the Kubernetes agent operator.

```shell
helm upgrade k8s-agents-operator newrelic/k8s-agents-operator -n newrelic
```

## Uninstalling the Kubernetes agent operator [#uninstall-k8s-operator]

### Bundle installation

Uninstall the nri-bundle chart or if you only want to remove the operator, run a helm upgrade with the following parameter:

```shell
k8s-agents-operator.enabled=false
```

### Standalone installation

To uninstall and delete the Kubernetes agent operator, run this command:

```shell
helm uninstall k8s-agents-operator -n newrelic
```

## Find and use data [#find-data]

* Get insights of your applications and resolve incidents using the [APM summary](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/triage-run-diagnostics/) page.

* Check out the [Kubernetes summary](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) page. It provides Kubernetes insights in the context of your monitored applications.

## Frequently Asked Questions [#faq]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="route-apps-telemetry"
    title="Can I route my applications telemetry to different accounts?"
  >
    Yes, you just need to change your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) injected in the secret in the appropriate namespace.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The [K8s APM experience](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) is only available on the account where the data from the applications and the K8s cluster is available.

  <Collapser
    id="setup-operator"
    title="Can I setup the operator to inject an specific version of an APM agent?"
  >
    Yes, all available agent versions that support the operator are listed on Docker Hub:

    * [Java](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-java-init/general)
    * [Node](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-node-init/general)
    * [Python](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-python-init/general)
    * [.NET](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-init/general)
    * [Ruby](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-init/general)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="modify-conf-apm"
    title="Can I install the K8s agent operator if my applications are already instrumented?"
  >
    Installing two APM agents in the same application can potentially lead to unexpected issues. Therefore, we strongly recommend removing any existing instrumentation before installing the operator.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-apm"
    title="Can I use custom instrumentation with the K8s agent operator?"
  >
    Yes, custom instrumentation will work the same as without the operator. The primary difference is that the agent is now injected by the operator instead of installed in the container with the rest of the application dependencies. You can still import and call the agent API to add custom instrumentation into your application. You can also utilize a configuration file or environment variables to add custom instrumentation if the particular agent you are using supports it. Note agents have order of precendence between configuration via environment variables and configuration via configuration files so you will need to make sure your environment variable configuration via the operator is not clashing with your configuration via configuration file. See each agents custom instrumentation docs for details:

    * [Java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-custom-instrumentation/)
    * [Node](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-custom-instrumentation/)
    * [Python](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation/)
    * [.NET](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation/)
    * [Ruby](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/ruby-custom-instrumentation/)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="read-only-file-system"
    title="Can I install the K8s agent operator if my applications are running on a read-only file system?"
  >
    No, because the operator is injecting the agent at application runtime, it needs access to write to the application container's file system.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

If your applications are not instrumented, you should check the following:

* Please be sure to redeploy or deploy new applications after the operator has been installed. Please be advised that the operator only auto-instruments new applications deployed in the cluster.

* Check that the secret and the instrumentation CRD are installed in the app's namespace.

  ```shell
  kubectl get secrets -n NAMESPACE
  kubectl get instrumentation -n NAMESPACE
  ```

* Check that the pod has the required labels that enable automatic instrumentation through CR when using podLabelSelector. Similarly, check that the namespace has the required labels when using namespaceLabelSelector inside the CR.

  ```shell
  kubectl get pod POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'
  ```

* Get logs from the agent operator pod.

  ```shell
  kubectl logs AGENT_OPERATOR_POD -n newrelic
  ```

* Ensure the `init` container has been injected and sucessfully executed inside the application's pod.

  ```shell
  kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE
  ```

## Support [#support]

The Kubernetes agent operator currently supports the latest version of these  APM agents: Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

Once the operator is on general availability, the most recent 3 versions of each of the APM agents will be supported.

For issues with the Kubernetes agent operator:

* Review the [issues section on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-agents-operator/issues) for any similar problems or consider opening a new issue.

* You can reach out to the [New Relic support](https://support.newrelic.com/) team for assistance.
