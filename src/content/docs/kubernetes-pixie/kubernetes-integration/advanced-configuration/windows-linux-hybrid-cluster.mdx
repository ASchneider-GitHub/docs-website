You can create your own manifest file using Helm to cover all your needs, such as to set the proxy you want to use. To understand all the power of Helm, we recommend you to read [how to install Kubernetes integration using Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm) before going through this document.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

* Ensure [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) matches your Kubernetes integration version. For example, version 3 of the Kubernetes integration requires Helm version 3.
* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* Your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
* Your Kubernetes cluster's name.
  * If you need a display name for your cluster, you can use the output of the following command:
    ```shell
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

## Templating Kubernetes integration with Helm [#install-k8-helm]

  Installing and upgrading using a manifest isn't supported and is prone to errors. Be completely sure that this is the approach you need for your environment.

1. Add the New Relic Helm charts repository by running:
  ```shell
  helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
  ```
