You can configure your IAST to handle scan scheduling. These configurations allow you to exclude certain APIs, parameters, and vulnerability categories from IAST analysis. You can also delay IAST scans or schedule them for specific times of the day.

## Scheduling IAST Scans [#scheduling-iast-scans]

You can start and stop your scheduled IAST scans using 2 variables. These variables allow you to set specific times for the IAST scan or add a delay to the IAST scan start time from the application.


### Configure your scheduled IAST scans [#configure-scheduled]

Open the `newrelic.yml` configuration file to set the `scan_schedule` parameters.

```yml
security:
  scan_schedule:
    delay: 0			          #In minutes, default is 0 min
    duration: 0		          #In minutes, default is forever
    schedule: ""                    #Cron Expression to define start time
    always_sample_traces: false     #regardless of scan schedule
```

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="delay"
        title={<><InlineCode>delay</InlineCode> (in minutes)</>}
    >
        The `delay` field specifies the time in minutes before an IAST scan begins after the application starts. The default value is `0`.

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="duration"
        title={<><InlineCode>duration</InlineCode> (in minutes)</>}
    >
        The `duration` field specifies the length of time in minutes that the IAST scan will run. The default value is forever, it has no limits.

        For example, if you set `duration: 300`, the IAST scan will run for 300 minutes (5 hours).

    <Collapser
        id="schedule-cron"
        title={<><InlineCode>schedule</InlineCode> (Cron expression)</>}
    >
        The `schedule` field specifies a cron expression that defines when the IAST scan should run. By default, `schedule` is disabled. The [cron expression](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) consists of six fields separated by spaces:

        * **second**: Specifies the second of the hour (0-59) 
        * **minute**: Specifies the minute of the hour (0-59)
        * **hour**: Specifies the hour of the day (0-23)
        * **day**: Specifies the day of the month (1-31)
        * **month**: The month of the year (1-12 or JAN-DEC)
        * **day_of_week**: Specifies the day of the week (1-7 or SUN-SAT), where 1 = Sunday

        <Callout variant="important">
          What happens if `duration` is not specified? Omitting the duration parameter implies that the IAST scan should never stop. In this scenario, the specified schedule is treated as a start time rather than a recurring operation. The scan will continue indefinitely without interruption or termination. For example, `schedule: "0 0 0 * * ?"` would schedule the IAST scan to run at 12am every day.

    <Collapser
        id="always-sample-traces"
        title={<><InlineCode>always_sample_traces</InlineCode> (Boolean)</>}
    >
        `always-sample-traces` allows IAST to actively collect trace data in the background, and the security agent will use this collected data to perform an IAST scan at the scheduled time. However, for applications with session management, we strongly recommend setting the `always_sample_traces` flag to false. This ensures that IAST sampling and scanning is limited to a specified window. Sessions typically have a short lifetime, often ending within 30 minutes. In this scenario, sampling traces before the window will not provide valuable insight and may result in missed vulnerabilities. By default, the value of `always_sample_traces` is false.
