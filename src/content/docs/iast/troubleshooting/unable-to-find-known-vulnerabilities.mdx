## Problem

I tested an application with known vulnerabilities, but IAST couldn't detect these.


## Solution
<Callout variant="important">
IAST starts testing when detects that there is traffic, so check if your application works out or has any traffic directed at it. Perform the app's UI or API endpoints. 
Also, IAST requires restarting the application after it's enabled.
</Callout>

Ensure that you are using a [suppoted application framework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents-products/) and the [latest instrumentation package](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent#instrumentation-packages) for your application. 


## Cause

Following could be the reasons if IAST doesn't detect known vulnerabilities:

    - IAST doesn't support application framework.

    - There is no instrumentation for the module.
