## Problem

I tested an application with known vulnerabilities, but IAST couldn't detect these.


## Solution

Ensure that you are using a [suppoted application framework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents-products/) and the [latest instrumentation package](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent#instrumentation-packages) for your application. 



## Cause

Following could be the reasons if IAST doesn't detect known vulnerabilities:

    - IAST doesn't support application framework.

    - There is no instrumentation for the module.
