## Details and remediation of a vulnerability [#remediation-vuln]

IAST provides accurate out-of-the-box results with detailed vulnerability descriptions and detections down to the line of code.

To see the details and the remediation instructions of a vulnerability:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST** and click **Exploitable Vulnerabilities** on the left navigation pane.

2. In the **Detected exploitable vulnerabilities** table, select an exploitable vulnerability to explore its details and understand how to address it. You can search the detected vulnerabilities by severity, file name, or application name. You can also order each column.

3. The **Understanding the exploitable vulnerability** section gives you information about the details, the stack trace, and the HTTP request of the vulnerability.

4. Expand the **Run the exploit** section to copy the curl you'll find here you can use to reproduce the issue as well as retest once remediated.

5. Once you've applied the suggested fix, rebuild your application, and rerun IAST.

6. Ensure you update the status to mark the vulnerability status as either a false positive, resolved, or unresolved.
