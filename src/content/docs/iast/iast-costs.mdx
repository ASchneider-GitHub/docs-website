It's important for you to know how you'll be billed when you use interactive application security testing (IAST). You are billed for this capability through an optional add-on called [Compute Add On](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing). This is the third of the three billing factors at New Relic: 

* The amount of data you ingest
* The number of billable users you have
* The optional add-ons you've purchased.

Once you have this add-on, New Relic calculates your IAST costs based on the [Compute Capacity Units (CCUs)](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) you consume.

## Learn about IAST costs [#iast-costs]

CCUs are consumed when you use the IAST capability to analyze an application for exploitable vulnerabilities. In order to assess the potential vulnerability of your application, attack simulations are used to generate responses from the application. Each response is analyzed to determine the nature of the behavior. If the behavior is unsafe, the status for the test run will be set to **Exploitable**. This means that in a production environment, an attacker could use one of these vulnerabilities to exploit your applications, infrastructure, or data. It's important to consider these factors when using IAST to ensure optimal consumed CCUs: the complexity of your application, the efficiency of your testing, and the number of test runs.

You can view costs broken out by feature and drill into IAST usage in account administration. We provide you the ability to see daily usage and 30-day rolling usage. Also,we break this down to attribute usage to specific accounts or users and APIs.
