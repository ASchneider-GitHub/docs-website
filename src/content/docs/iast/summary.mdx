The New Relic IAST summary page provides a centralized view of your tested applications, vulnerabilities, coverage, and more at a glance. Viewing vulnerabilites along with their risk scores and potential exposure helps you to prioritize remediation decisions quickly.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST** to open the IAST summary page.

The IAST summary page includes these sections on the left navigation pane:

- **A: Overview**. When you open the [IAST UI](https://one.newrelic.com/iast/summary), the IAST summary page opens.

- **B: Findings**. It includes the pages on [vulnerabilities](/docs/iast/exploitable-vulns/) and [applications](/docs/iast/applications/).

- **C: Settings**. This section includes the [install page](/docs/iast/install/) to start testing your applications for any exploitable vulnerability.


These are the different parts of the summary page:

- **Vulnerability severity**. Check out a summary of the number of vulnerabilities you have by the [CVSS severity score](/docs/iast/overview/#vuln-severity): critical, high, and the other along with their resolution status.

- **IAST coverage**. Pie chart with a view of the total number of applications and the number of tested and untested applications.

- **Test applications**. Take a glance at the number of vulnerable applications you have.

- **Take these actions**:
    - **Fix these exploitable applications**. This table shows you a list of the most exploitable applications. Click on an application to view and fix the exploitable vulnerabilities in your applications. 
    
    - **Test these applications**. This is a list of the untested applications. Click on an untested application if you want to [enable IAST](/docs/iast/applications/#enable-iast) and find vulnerabilities to improve your security coverage.

- **Potential exposure category**. This is an ordered list based on the nature of all the APIs analyzed across all applications providing you details on which OWASP categories you have are potentially vulnerable to based on our testing.

- **Detected exploitable exposure category**. This is a pie chart of all actual exploitable vulnerabilities by OWASP category. You can compare this to the potential exposure chart to understand what types of vulnerabilities you are most susceptible to and are exploitable.
