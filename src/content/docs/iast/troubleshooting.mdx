    If you don't see anything here it's likely because the application has not been exercised or had any traffic directed at it. IAST won't start testing until some app traffic has been generated. Exercise the aapp's UI or API endpoints.

    If this is a new app, firewalls could be preventing it from communicating with the NR platform. Check the service stats section in the file with the latest timestamp in `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots`. All 6 items in that list should say OK. If they don't, review the logs for additional info or reach out to [support](https://support.newrelic.com). You can also see the [standard firewall documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/).
