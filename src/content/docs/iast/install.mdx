<Callout variant="important">
    Run IAST with non-production deployments only.

    Why? IAST tests by invoking HTTP requests with an exploit payload. You must use IAST in non-production environments with only simulated data to avoid both data corruption and introducing exploits into your live code. In addition, when you run IAST on new code in pre-production, you catch potential vulnerabilities before they go live.

To install New Relic IAST:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST** and click **Set up IAST with applications**.

        alt="Set up IAST with applications"
        src={iastSetup}
    />

2. Confirm IAST is not running in a production environment and click **Continue**.

3. Select the language of your application and complete the steps.

        alt="Install New Relic IAST"
        src={iastInstall}
    />

4. Make sure your `newrelic.yml` config file is updated as follows:

    ```yml
    host: staging-collector.newrelic.com
    security:
        enabled: true
    agent:
        enabled: true
    validator_service_url: wss://csec-staging.nr-data.net
    ```

5. Once you've completed all the steps, restart your application and generate traffic against the application's APIs.

6. Click **See your data** to see an overview of your tested application.
