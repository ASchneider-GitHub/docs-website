Promotions are special offers to try out product features at New Relic. You can browse through our various promotions and enroll through our promotions management UI. 

The type of promotion currently available is the product preview. This is the opportunity to try out a feature before it is released (pre-GA). The promotions management UI gives you:

* One-stop shopping for previews : View all available product previews in one place
* Enrollment flexibility: Easily sign-up or leave from product previews until they become generally available (GA)
* Upgrade options: Upgrade to access products once they are generally available 

To help you get started, we've provided some tips about eligibility and enrollment.

## Eligibility [#eligibility]

You can check the plan management page to see if your organization is eligible for a product promotion. If you don't see the promotions UI, your organization isn't eligible.

All promotions apply to the entire organization, including all users and all accounts that belong to your organization.

### Users [#users]

Any user in an organization can sign up for a product promotion. However, only users who have the **Billing** administrative setting in their group can do the following: 

* Leave a promotion 
* Re-enroll after leaving a promotion

### Organizations [#org-rules]

Organizations can be enrolled in more than one preview at a time. Also, most organizations are eligible for promotions, with some exceptions. Ineligible organizations are ones that: 

* Have HIPAA-enabled accounts
* Use FedRAMP-compliant endpoints
* Don't allow for click-through agreement (for example, key accounts) 
* Have contractual restrictions
* Use the original product-based pricing model

## Browse available previews [#access-ui]

The promotions management UI lists available product promotions in a single, consolidated table view. Each row in the table contains essential information such as the product name, a brief description, preview status (**Available**, **Opted In**, **Opted Out**), and the anticipated end date of the preview. 

    <img

        alt="Screenshot showing the promotions table"
        src={accountsPromotionsTable}
    />

Some promotions don't have a defined end date, so you may see the end date as **Ongoing**. We try to provide a best estimate of the length of the preview, but it is provided for informational purposes only.

<Callout variant="important">
  The end date should not be construed as an offer, commitment, promise or obligation on behalf of New Relic to deliver any product, material, code, functionality, or other feature.

## Sign up for a product promotion [#sign-up-or-leave]

To sign up for a promotion or to leave one you're currently enrolled in: 

1. Log into New Relic.
2. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), go to **Administration > Usage Summary**.
3. Click **Previews & trials** (If you can't see this menu, you're not eligible):
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing the promotions UI"
        alt="Screenshot showing the promotions UI"
        src={accountsPreviewsandTrials}
    />
4. Open the ellipsis menu (**...**) for the promotion you're interested in, and then select one of the following:
    * **Enroll**
    * **Leave Preview**

When you're finished, a confirmation message will appear. 

## Upgrade after preview feature is released [#upgrade-at-ga]

Within a few days of a product preview becoming generally available (GA), you'll receive an in-product notification. You'll need to decide whether you would like to have access to the feature after it is generally available. 

1. On the notification, click **Manage preview**.

        alt="Screenshot showing the notification banner"
        src={accountsManagePreview}
    />
2. On the **Previews & trials** page, click **Upgrade**, and then follow the prompts to access the GA feature.
