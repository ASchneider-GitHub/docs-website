In addition to the primary billing factors of ingest and billable users, you can also purchase optional add-ons to enhance your experience with New Relic: 

* **EU Data Center for New Relic - Data, and New Relic - Data Plus**: This add-on allows you to store data in the EU.
* **Extended Retention for New Relic - Data, and New Relic - Data Plus**: Go beyond the default length of time your data is retained. This applies to all your data&mdash;not just logs&mdash;and is a good option if you need to make a lot of small queries or make queries on large volumes of data.
* **New Relic Synthetic Checks**: Go above the default number of synthetic monitor checks.
* **Vulnerability Management**: Monitor and remediate vulnerabilities with this add-on. This is included with Data Plus, but it's an add-on without Data Plus.
* **Live Archives Storage**: Extend your log storage duration by at least 90 days more than standard retention. This add-on is best if you need to keep logs that you'll query infrequently. Live archives also requires Compute Add On. 
* **Compute Add On**: This add-on activates usage-based billing for queries you run against Interactive Security Testing (IAST) and live archives. It measures your usage based on [Compute Capacity Units (CCUs)](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit). This add-on is also required for live archives. 

To get started with any of these optional add-ons, get in touch with your New Relic account team.
