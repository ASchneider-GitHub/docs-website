Depending on your pricing edition and other factors, we offer various options for reducing data ingest, deleting or uninstalling an agent or integration, or downgrading or cancelling your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure).

## Reduce or stop data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data. 

For how to manage data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures:

* [Remove <InlinePopover type="apm" />, <InlinePopover type="browser" />, and <InlinePopover type="mobile" /> apps](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/)
* [Remove infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-agent/)
* For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can [search New Relic solutions here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

## Downgrade your edition [#downgrading]

There are two options for downgrading your [edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions), depending on whether you're pay-as-you-go or not: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="payg-downgrade"
    title="Pay-as-you-go organizations"
  >
To downgrade a Standard or Pro [pay-as-you-go](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) organization: 

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT>. 
2. Click <DNT>**Plans and pricing**</DNT>. 
3. Under the <DNT>**Free**</DNT> pricing option, mouse over <DNT>**Downgrade to free**</DNT> and click the button that appears.
4. On the window that appears, scroll to the bottom and enter a reason for cancellation. 
5. Click the box noting that you agree to the terms of service. 
6. Click <DNT>**Submit.**</DNT>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="contract-downgrade"
    title="Organizations with contracts"
  >
If you have a Pro or Enterprise edition with [a long-term contract](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) and wish to downgrade, talk to your New Relic account representative. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Delete an account [#delete-account]

If you're using the Pro or Enterprise edition, you can delete one or more accounts while keeping your organization.

When you delete an account:

* Users, groups, and custom roles remain, but access grants that are assigned to an account will lose that connection to the account. You should also remove any access grant associated with this account, otherwise users may see errors when they try to view it.
* Any API keys associated with a deleted account become inactive and can't be reassigned to another account. 
* You can't reverse this decision. Once you delete the account, it is no longer accessible. 

To delete an account using the UI:

1. Make sure you're in a group that has the Organization [administrative setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).
2. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), go to **Administration > Access Management**.
3. Select the **Accounts** tab.
4. Select the ellipsis to the right of the account you want to remove. 
5. Click **remove account**.

## Delete your organization [#cancel]

If you want to delete your New Relic organization entirely, you can only do so if your organization has downgraded to free and has just one remaining account. 

### When you can delete an organization [#when-delete-org]

Before trying to delete your organization, please confirm the folloiwng: 

* Your organization only has one account and one user.
  * If you have more than one account in your organization, either use the [UI](#delete-account) to delete all but one of your accounts, or contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal) for help with this.
  * If you have more than one user, you can delete users via the [User management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#delete-users) or via [Nerdgraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users/#delete-users).
* Your organization is on our newer pricing model. 
    * If you're not sure which model you're on, see [Pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models/#determine-pricing) for how to determine that. 
    * If you're on the older pricing model, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
* You organization is on the free edition. In other words, you can't be on standard, pro, or enterprise editions with paid subscriptions. If you have an active paid subscription, see the [Downgrade your edition](#downgrading) above in this document.

### To delete your organization, follow these steps:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>.
2. Click <DNT>**Access management**</DNT>.
3. Click <DNT>**Delete organization**</DNT>. If you don't see that option, ensure you've met the requirements above. For additional help, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
