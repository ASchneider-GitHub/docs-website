The Kubernetes APM <DNT>**summary**</DNT> page provides general information about the selected application, including the age of the current deployment, the number of pods available, CPU and memory usage, pod logs, and metric comparison.

## Monitor the deployment of your Kubernetes cluster [#monitor-kubernetes]

The Kubernetes page in APM offers the following information about your application:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="deployment-summary"
    title="Deployment summary"
  >
    You can see your cluster name, deployment, and namespace that it's running in. If you click the deployment, you'll get details about it in a slide-out panel.

    In the <DNT>**Instances**</DNT> drop-down, you can select a single pod instance of your service.

      alt="This is an image of the Kubernetes APM page"
      src="/images/apm_screenshot-crop_k8-header.webp"
    />

    If you have a multi-cluster app (an app that spans multiple clusters), the <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT> page shows you a summary of all the clusters. To isolate a specific cluster, select it from the <DNT>**Cluster**</DNT> drop-down list. To return to a view of all clusters, click <DNT>**All clusters**</DNT>.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="current-deployment"
    title="Current deployment"
  >
    You can check how many pods are available or desired, the pods that are missing, and the age of the kubernetes deployment, which is the date when the deployment was first created.

      alt="This is an image of the Kubernetes APM page"
      src="/images/apm_screenshot-crop_k8-current-deploy.webp"
    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="performance-summary"
    title="Performance summary for the deployment"
  >
    You can see the CPU and memory utilization, as well as the number of pod restarts.

    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="pods-containers"
    title="Pods and containers"
  >
    You can check pod and their related containers details. If you click the pod or container name, you'll get some details about it in a slide-out panel.

    In addition, with the <DNT>**Logs**</DNT> button, you can see the logs in context to that pod.

      alt="This is an image of the Kubernetes APM page"

    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="activity-stream"
    title="Activity stream"
  >
    You can see the stream of Kubernetes events related to that deployment and its pods.

    <img
      title="Kubernetes page - Activity stream"
      alt="This is an image of the Kubernetes APM page"
      src="/images/apm_screenshot-crop_k8-activity-stream.webp"
    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metrics-comparison"
    title="Metrics comparison"
  >
    These widgets let you compare a static list of metrics related to the pods-containers in the deployment, as well as other metrics such as CPU, network, storage.

    <img
      title="Kubernetes page - Metrics Comparison"
      alt="This is an image of the Kubernetes APM page"
      src="/images/apm_screenshot-crop_k8-metric-comparasin.webp"
    />

    The following metrics are available:

    * CPU usage (cores)
    * CPU throttling (%)
    * Memory usage (bytes)
    * Network received (KBps)
    * Network transmitted (KBps)
    * Network errors (per second)
    * Storage usage (bytes)
    * Storage utilization (%)
    * Container restart count
    * Service throughtput (requests per minute)
    * Service response time (ms)
    * Service error rate (%)
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Link your applications to Kubernetes [#link-app]

You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents no matter if you use NR proprietary agents or OpenTelemetry.
APM uses the Kubernetes metadata to display the specific Kubernetes deployment information related to that APM application.

### New Relic proprietary instrumentation

When you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, New Relic's metadata injection comes into play automatically via the nri-metadata-injection parameter. 
It's the MutatingAdmissionWebhook, set up by the Kubernetes instrumentation, that takes on the job of tagging your Pods with the necessary environment variables. 
From there, the data captured in these variables gets carried over to your APM metrics and entities, enriching them with valuable context.

For more information, see how to [link your applications to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-your-applications-kubernetes/).

The following attributes are required in the APM service entity to display the Kubernetes summary page

* k8s.clusterName 
* k8s.namespaceName
* k8s.deploymentName


### OpenTelemetry instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry collector offers a Kubernetes attributes processor that enrich APM telemetry with Kubernetes metadata.

* First, you need to define an environment variable in your deployment manifest
* Next, adjust the collector's configuration so it pulls in the pertinent Kubernetes metadata using that APM environment variable.

As a result, all the APM metrics and entities will include Kubernetes metadata thanks to the K8sattributes processor.
For more information, see how to [link your OpenTelemetry applications to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-otel-applications-kubernetes/).

The following attributes are required in the APM service entity to display the Kubernetes summary page

* k8s.cluster.name
* k8s.deployment.name
* k8s.namespace.name

<Callout variant="warning">
The Kubernetes summary page won't function correctly if there's a mix of different instrumentation providers (newRelic and OpenTelemetry). 
To have it work properly, both Kubernetes and APM need to be monitored either exclusively through New Relic's proprietary agents or entirely via OpenTelemetry. 

As of now, we don't support hybrid scenarios.
