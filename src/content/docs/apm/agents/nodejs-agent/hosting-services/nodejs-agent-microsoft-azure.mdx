## Easy Install with the New Relic Azure Site Extension for Node [#site-extension-install]

You can install the Node.js agent onto your Azure-managed web apps with the New Relic Azure Site Extension for Node. This doc walks you through compatibility, installation, and configuration to get your Azure web app data into New Relic.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

Azure Site Extensions are only available for Windows-based App Service apps that are deployed as code. For applications running on Windows 32, full Code Level Metrics support (file path, line, column) is not available. Profiling falls back to function name only.

## Install the Node.js agent with Azure Site Extension

To install the New Relic Azure Site Extension, add the `NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension.NodeAgent` site extension from the Azure home page. Follow these steps:

1. From the Azure Home page, click the App Services tile, then select the target application in the displayed list.
2. Scroll down to <DNT>**Extensions**</DNT> in the options listed on the left under the <DNT>**Development Tools**</DNT> category.
3. Click on <DNT>**+ Add**</DNT> at the top of the page to toggle the extension drop down, then select <DNT>**New Relic Node Agent**</DNT>. Check the box for accepting the legal terms
4. Click <DNT>**Add**</DNT> on the bottom of the page to start installing the extension.

Once installed, the extension creates the following artifacts:

* Folder: `C:\home\SiteExtensions\NewRelic.Azure.Websites.Extension.NodeAgent`
- XDT: `applicationHost.xdt` that will add the necessary `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable on application startup
- The New Relic Node agent and dependencies will be installed into `C:\home\site\wwwroot\node_modules`

If the New Relic agent has been installed successfully and logging has been enabled, the agent will append its logs to a file at `C:\home\site\wwwroot\newrelic_agent.log`. If the extension fails to install, a log file is created at `C:\home\SiteExtensions\NewRelic.Azure.Websites.Extension.NodeAgent\install.log`.

## Configure the Node.js agent [#configure-agent]

The New Relic Node agent is configured with the `newrelic.js` file, or via environment variables. [See our documentation for more detailed configuration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/).

Once the site extension is installed, you'll need to manually enter one configuration item before restarting your application.
  - On the options listed on the left, scroll down to "Environment variables" located under the "Settings" category and add the following:
    - `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` - Your New Relic license key value

The Node agent automatically adds the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable with a value of `-r newrelic` which starts the agent.
  - Note: Any previously defined `NODE_OPTIONS` will be removed and reset with `-r newrelic`.

  <Callout variant="important">
    We recommend installing or removing this Azure site extension while your web application is stopped.
  </Callout>

## Manual Installation

Learn about special considerations for using Microsoft Azure Web Apps as a hosting service with New Relic's Node.js agent.

## What you need [#compatibility]

In addition to the [Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent), this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform:

* Install the Azure SDK for Node.js.
* Ensure Git is installed.

<Callout variant="important">
  The Node.js agent cannot deliver telemetry for Azure Functions. Instead, you will need to use the [Azure Functions monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-functions-monitoring-integration/)
</Callout>

## Installing the Node.js agent [#install_nodejs]

To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application make sure the `newrelic` module is loaded first, use the Node.js `-r`/`--require` flag to run the following:

```shell
node -r newrelic server.js
```

<Callout variant="important">
  For a Next.js app, load our agent via `NODE_OPTIONS`, such as:

  ```shell
  NODE_OPTIONS='-r newrelic' next start
  ```
</Callout>

## Adding app settings in Azure [#azure_settings]

After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps:

1. Sign in to <DNT>**[portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)**</DNT>.
2. Select <DNT>**App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure**</DNT>.
3. Add the following to the <DNT>**app settings**</DNT>:

   * `new_relic_app_name`: Your Windows Azure website name
   * `new_relic_license_key`: Your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>
4. Save your settings.
5. Restart your Node.js app.

Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select your app)**</DNT>.

## Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI [#app_settings]

Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node.js SDK):

```bash
azure account download "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME"
azure account import "PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE"
azure site config add "new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME"
azure site config add "new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME
```

## Using environment variables [#variables]

If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in `newrelic.js` have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables [override your configuration file settings](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#methods-and-precedence).

For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use `APP_POOL_ID` as the application name ([`NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`](/docs/nodejs/configuring-nodejs-with-environment-variables#app_name)) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice. For more information, see [Configuring Node.js with environment variables](/docs/nodejs/configuring-nodejs-with-environment-variables).
