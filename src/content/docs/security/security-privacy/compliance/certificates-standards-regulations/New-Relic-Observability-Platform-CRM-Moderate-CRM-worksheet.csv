"New Relic Observability Platform
FedRAMP Moderate Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet",,
"This CRM provides details for a Customer of what their responsibilities are for a given control, including responsibilities for optional services (applicable depending on which services the customer acquires).  The CRM contains information for what a Customer needs to implement in order to obtain and maintain their authorization/certification. The Customer responsibility outlines the remaining controls that need to be implemented by the leveraging entity for compliance. 


GUIDANCE: 

1.  Review the CRM to define all the controls that will need to be engineered, designed, defined and implemented in order to be in compliance with the FedRAMP baseline.
2.  Mark controls with ""Yes"" designation in the ""Can Be Inherited from CSP"" column as Fully Inherited from New Relic F1607057910 FedRAMP Authorized: 03/02/2020.
3.  Mark controls with ""Partial"" designation in the ""Can Be Inherited from CSP"" column as Partially Inherited from New Relic F1607057910 FedRAMP Authorized: 03/02/2020. Customers must describe their responsibilities in their Customer-level system security plan.
4.  Controls with a ""No"" designation in the ""Can Be Inherited from CSP"" column cannot be Fully nor Partially inherited.  Customers must describe their responsibilities in their Customer-level system security plan.
