Our New Relic [PHP APM Agent](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) currently provides support for detecting CVEs related to packages from the following frameworks:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Packages</th>
      <th>Minimum Version</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Drupal</td>
      <td>8.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Guzzle</td>
      <td>6.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Laravel</td>
      <td>6.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PHPUnit</td>   
      <td>9.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Predis</td>
      <td>2.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Slim</td>    
      <td>2.X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wordpress</td>    
      <td>5.9.X</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

It's recommended to use [officially supported versions](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) of PHP. Note, the PHP agent differs from other language agents as it is not aware of packages until they are used. If the version is not specified in the package's source code in an accessible way, the PHP agent is unable to provide version detection information for that package, and vulnerabilities will not be shown.

To disable package detection for Vulnerability Management, you can find more information on the [configuration page](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-package-detection).
