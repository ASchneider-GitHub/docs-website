With New Relic FOSSA integration - you can enhance security of applications as you stay up-to-date with the latest exploitable vulnerabilities that impact your application code including vulnerabilities emerging from open source code usage!

You can view all your application vulnerabilities, including open-source vulnerabilities, alongside other application’s health and performance metrics- all in one place - at your New Relic dashboard! 

You can also view the overall list of vulnerabilities, their priorities, modify priorities if needed, see a detailed view of each vulnerability and recommended steps to remediate them.

## Prerequisites

* [New Relic account](http://newrelic.com/signup).
* [FOSSA account](https://app.fossa.com/auth/register).

## Steps to Integrate

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Obtain FOSSA API Token 

    1. Log in to your FOSSA account.
    3. Navigate to [Account Settings](https://app.fossa.com/account/settings/integrations/api_tokens).
    4. Create a new full access API token (push-only tokens are not supported). Learn more about [API tokens](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/authentication)

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Search for FOSSA integration

    1. Log in to your New Relic account and navigate to the [Integrations & Agents](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) page.
    2. Search for the FOSSA integration.
    3. Click on the FOSSA logo.
    
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Enter FOSSA account details

    1. Enter the FOSSA **API token** you obtained in [step 1](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/fossa/#obtain-fossa-api-token).
    2. Enter **account name** which will serve as a unique identifier for the FOSSA account you are integrating with.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure polling

    1. Select the desired frequency for New Relic to poll FOSSA for updates on vulnerabilities in your projects.
    2. Click **Save** to confirm your configuration.
    3. Once the integration is complete, Click on **Go to Vulnerability Management** button to see your data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## See your data
Once the integration is complete, the first polling process can take up to **10 minutes** to reflect data in New Relic. 

Check out 2 ways you can use to identify FOSSA data in New Relic:

### View data in Vulnerability Management [#view-data-vuln-dashboard]

1. Navigate to [Vulnerability Management](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management) page.
  <img
    title="Vulnerability management screen"
    alt="Vulnerability management screen"
    src="/images/accounts_screenshot-full_vm-landing-updated.webp"
  />
2. Click on the **Vulnerabilities** tab. This will display a list of all vulnerabilities discovered across your monitored applications.
3. Utilize the filters available on the page. Locate the Source filter and select Fossa. This will filter the list to show only vulnerabilities identified by the FOSSA integration.

    alt="Vulnerability management vulnerabilities tab"
    src="/images/vm_screenshot-full_vuln-tab.webp"
  />


### Querying vulnerability events [#query-vuln-events]

When Fossa events are processed, they're stored in the **Vulnerability** table. To query this table and view the raw data, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Query your data**.
2. Enter the following query:

   ```sql
   FROM Vulnerability SELECT * where source = 'Fossa' since 7 days ago
   ```

## Benefits of the new integration

* **Centralized application performance and security monitoring**: See FOSSA’s list of open-source vulnerabilities that may impact your code, alongside your application performance, health and other security metrics **all in one place** in your New Relic dashboard!
* **Improved Code Quality and developer confidence**:  Continue building secure applications as you add open source code (and thus related dependencies!). This list of dependencies/ vulnerabilities is continuously updated with leveraging FOSSA integration.
* **Enhanced Compliance**: Demonstrate adherence to security standards and regulations by centrally managing open-source vulnerabilities.
