New Relic Vulnerability Management may detect a good amount of vulnerabilities across your system. Most of these vulnerabilities may need remediation, but some might be not be applicable to your environment or your internal policies might categorize them as low risk, or limited exposure due to how your systems leverage the potentially vulnerable component.

Understanding that you may want to tailor your visibility by entity or criticality, New Relic Vulnerability Management allows you to manage your vulnerabilities by:

* Assigning individual entities to an `Ignored` status so their vulnerabilities no longer appear in Vulnerability Management
* Ignoring a certain kind of vulnerability in bulk so it no longer appears across multiple entities 
* Removing the `Ignored` status at a later date if you want to view and review those vulnerabilities again

## Ignore a vulnerability [#ignore-vulnerability]

You can manually ignore vulnerabilities on a per entity basis. Once you set the status of an instance to `Ignored`, weâ€™ll exclude this instance from the summary tiles and vulnerability list by default. Other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still keep the `Affected` status.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="ignore-entity"
        title="Ignore a vulnerability for a specific entity"
    >

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All entities > (select your entity) > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab, then select the vulnerability you want to ignore. If you don't see the vulnerability you want to manage, it might already have the `Ignored` status. 

    <img
    title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity"
    alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management"
    src={vmIgnoreEntityVulnList}
    />

1. To update the status to `Ignored`, click the **Change to ignored** button. 

        <img
            title="Vulnerability instance details pages"
            alt="An image showing the change to ignored button on vulnerability instance details page"
            src={vmIgnoreEntityDetails}
        />

1. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability. Include a time period that the vulnerability should be ignored.

    <img
        title="Vulnerability instance details form"
        alt="An image showing the ignore form on vulnerability instance details page"
        src={vmIgnoreEntityForm}
    />

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="bulk-ignore"
        title="Ignore a vulnerability across multiple instances"
    >

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab, then choose the vulnerability you want to ignore. By default, this vulnerability view filters To vulnerabilities where at least one entity is marked `Affected`.

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities tab for all entities"
        alt="An image showing the all entities vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management"
        src={vmIgnoreBulkVulnList}
    />

1. Referring to **Area of Impact**, select each entity you want to ignore, then click the **Change to ignored** button.
    
    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities details"
        alt="An image showing the selection of specific entities"

1. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring th is vulnerability. Include a time period that the vulnerability should be ignored.

## Change Ignored status to Affected [#bulk-manage]

It's good practice to review ignored vulnerabilities and validate whether they should stay ignored. Changing the status from Ignored to Affected reintroduces the vulnerability back into default views and counts on this entity, but other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still remain ignored.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="remove-ignored"
        title="Remove ignored status for a specific entity"
    >

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All entities > (select the entity you want to update) > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab.
1. Update the filter from `Status = Affected` to `Status = Ignored`. This updates the default `Affected` view to instead display all the ignored vulnerabilities. 

    <img
    title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity"
    alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management with filter tab open"
    src={vmAffectedEntityVulnList}
    />

1. Choose the vulnerability that you want to update, then click **Change to affected**.

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity and only ignored instances"
        alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management filtered to only ignored instances"
        src={vmAffectedEntityDetails}
    />

1. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to `Affected`.
        
    <img
        title="Vulnerability instance details form"
        alt="An image showing the affected form on vulnerability instance details page"
        src={vmAffectedEntityForm}
    />

    <Collapser

    >

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 
1. From the settings cog, click the **Ignored** checkbox. This adds an ignore column to your vulnerability table.

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities tab with ignored column added"
        alt="An image showing the all entities vulnerabilities tab with an ignore column added"
        src={vmAffectedBulkVulnList}
    />

1. Select a vulnerability with an **Ignored** count greater than 0. 
1. Update the filter from `Status = Affected` to `Status = Ignored`. 

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities details"
        alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with the status dropdown open"
        src={vmAffectedBulkDetails}
    />

1. In the **Area of Impact** section, select the entities you want to mark `Affected`.

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities details with instances selected"
        alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with affected instances selected"
        src={vmAffectedBulkSelection}
    />

1. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to `Affected`.

    <img
        title="Vulnerabilities details with form open"
        alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with form to change instances to affected"
        src={vmAffectedBulkForm}

## Surface vulnerabilities assigned `Ignored` [#surface-vulnerabilities]

Before you assign `Ignored` to a vulnerability or entity, it's important to understand that the change affects how other code owners manage that particular instance. For example, marking a vulnerability or entity as `Ignored` prevents other users with account access from seeing that vulnerability. 

* You can surface `Ignored` vulnerabilities with the filter bar. From the filter bar, you can add `Status = Ignored` to view `Ignored` vulnerabilities. 
* From the the **Vulnerabilities** table, select **Ignored** to surface ignored vulnerabilities. 

At a minimum, we recommend reviewing your vulnerabilities every 90 days to ensure you aren't introducing risk into your system.

## Why ignore a vulnerability? [#why-ignore]

When you choose to ignore a vulnerability, you'll be prompted to explain the rationale behind the decision. For example, you might say that the vulnerable code is not used in the system, and therefore isn't currently relevant for maintaining the system. We recommend that when you give this context, you also provide supplemental documentation when possible. 

We'll also prompt you to set a duration for the `Ignored` status. Vulnerability Management will perform an automatic update that changes it from `Ignored` to `Affected`. If an instance is already considered **No Longer Detected**, the status will remain no longer detected.

## Permissions [#permissions]

Can't change a vulnerability status? Ask your administrator if you have permissions.
