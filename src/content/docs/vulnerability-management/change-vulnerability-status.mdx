New Relic Vulnerability Management may detect an overwhelming amount of vulnerabilities across your system. Most of these vulnerabilities may need remediation, but many might be low risk, or have limited external exposure. You can manage your vulnerabilities by:

* Assigning individual entities the Ignored status so their vulnerabilities no longer appear in Vulnerability Management
* Ignoring a certain kind of vulnerability in bulk so it no longer appears across multiple entities 
* Removing the Ignored status at a later date if you want to detect those vulnerabilities again

## Permissions [#permissions]

Vulnerability Management prevents users from changing vulnerability status if they lack the correct permissions. If you have a custom role in your org, reach out to the Admin to update your permissions to include this capability. You can review our [permissions documentation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#permissions-roles) to understand how permissions work. 

## Ignore a vulnerability [#ignore-vulnerability]

You can manually ignore vulnerabilities on a per entity basis. Once you set the status of an instance to Ignored, we’ll exclude this instance from the summary tiles and vulnerability list by default. Other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still keep the Affected status.

    >

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All entities** > (select your entity) > **Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab, then select the vulnerability you want to ignore. If you don't see the vulnerability you want to manage, it might already have the Ignored status.

            src={vmIgnoreEntityDetails}
        />

1. Fill out the form. The form asks you to explain the rationale behind ignoring this vulnerability and to designate a time period that status should be Ignored.

        #### Navigate to NRVM

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All capabilities** > Select the **Vulnerability Management** tile > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 

        #### Select a vulnerability

        Click the vulnerability that you wish to mark as ignored. By default, this vulnerability view is filtered to only show vulnerabilities where at least one entity is marked Affected.

        />

        #### Select the instances

        In the area of impact section, click the checkbox next to each entity that you wish to mark as ignored. Then click **Change to ignored** in the table header.

        />

        #### Fill out form

        Fill out the form explaining the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability and the time period in which the vulnerability should remain ignored. 

        When ignoring a vulnerability, you can select the reason behind the decision. One reason for ignoring a vulnerability is that the vulnerable code is not actually being used. When ignoring a vulnerability, you can provide details about your reasoning and a documentation link related to the investigation. 

        You can set the duration for this entity to be ignored. When the time period passes, Vulnerability Management will perform an automatic update setting it from ignored to affected. If an instance is already considered no longer detected, the status will remain no longer detected.

## Change Ignored status to Affected [#bulk-manage]

As time passes, it is good practice to review ignored vulnerabilities to validate if they should be addressed. A fix that was previously not available may become available or your threshold for addressing a vulnerability may change. To You can choose to set a vulnerability status back to affected on a per-entity basis.

    >

        #### Navigate to NRVM

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All entities** > Select the entity you wish to manage vulnerabilities > Under Triage click **Vulnerability Management** > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 

        #### Change the filter

        By default, this view only shows instances of the vulnerability with the affected status.
        
        Click the filter **Status = Affected** and change it to **Ignored**. 

        Now only vulnerabilities with the ‘Ignored’ status will be visible.

        alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management with filter tab open"
        src={vmAffectedEntityVulnList}
        />

        #### Select a vulnerability

        Click the vulnerability that you wish to change to affected.

        <img
            title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity and only ignored instances"
            alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management filtered to only ignored instances"
            src={vmAffectedEntityFiltered}
        />

        #### Change to affected

        Click **Change to affected** to begin the process of setting this vulnerability to affected. 
        
        Removing the ignored status will result in the vulnerability getting included in default views and counts on this entity. 
        
        Other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still remain ignored.

        #### Fill out form

        Fill out the form explaining the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to affected.

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All capabilities** > Select the **Vulnerability Management** tile > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 

        #### Find a vulnerability with ignored instances

        You can find ignored instances by clicking the **Settings Icon** and clicking the **Ignored** checkbox to add an ignore column to your vulnerability table.

        Now you can understand which vulnerabilies have instances ignored. Alternatively, you can change the status filter to **Ignored** to see vulnerabilities where all instances have been ignored.

        Select a vulnerability where the ignored count is greater than 0.

            title="Vulnerabilities tab with ignored column added"
            alt="An image showing the all entities vulnerabilities tab with an ignore column added"
            src={vmAffectedBulkVulnList}
        />

        #### Change the filter

        Click the filter **Status = Affected** and change it to **Ignored**. Now only entities with the vulnerability marked as ignored will be visible.

            title="Vulnerabilities details with instances selected"
            alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with affected instances selected"
            src={vmAffectedBulkSelection}
        />

        #### Fill out form
        
        Fill out the form explaining the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to affected. 

        <img
            title="Vulnerabilities details with form open"
            alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with form to change instances to affected"
            src={vmAffectedBulkForm}
        />

        #### Save the change

        Click **Save** when you are ready to submit the change of status. 
        
        Validate that the status has changed from ignored to affected. In this view, the affected entities should be hidden. To see them, you will need to adjust the status filter back to affected.

## Surface Ignored vulnerabilities [#surface-vulnerabilities]

Before you assign **Ignored** to a vulnerability or entity, it's important to understand that the change affects how other code owners manage that particular instance. For example, marking a vulnerability or entity as **Ignored** prevents other users with account access from seeing that vulnerability. 

* You can surface **Ignored** vulnerabilities with the filter bar. From the filter bar, you can add `Status = Ignored` to view Ignored vulnerabilities. 
* As best practice, we recommend reviewing your vulnerabilities at minimum once every 90 days to ensure you aren't introducing added risk into your system.

## Why ignore a vulnerability? [#why-ignore]

When ignoring a vulnerability, you can select the reason behind the decision. One reason for ignoring a vulnerability is that the vulnerable code is not actually being used. When ignoring a vulnerability, you can provide details about your reasoning and a documentation link related to the investigation. 

You can set the duration for this entity to be ignored. When the time period passes, Vulnerability Management will perform an automatic update setting it from ignored to affected. If an instance is already considered No Longer Detected, the status will remain no longer detected.
