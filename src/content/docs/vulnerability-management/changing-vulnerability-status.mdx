Many organizations have an overwhelming number of vulnerabilities detected within their system. But, not all of these vulnerabilities are high-risk, have remediations, or are run on systems of high operational importance or external exposure. NRVM allows you to ignore vulnerabilities on a per-entity basis, this allows for dashboards to only contain vulnerabilities that match your risk threshold and ensure your teams focus on impactful remediations. 

## Requirements 

- Vulnerability Management requires 'write' permissions for the [vulnerabilities capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#security) in order for a user to change the status of a vulnerability.

## Ignoring a vulnerability

Not all vulnerabilities detected by Vulnerability Management may require immediate attention. Using Vulnerability Management, you can manually ignore vulnerabilities on a per-entity basis. Once you set the status of an instance to ignored, we’ll exclude this instance from the summary tiles and vulnerability list by default. 

### Seeing ignored instances

Tables with a status filter can be adjusted from Affected to Ignored to see vulnerabilities that have been ignored. On views with data for more than one entity, all instances of a vulnerability must be marked as ignored for the vulnerability to be hidden.

### Ignoring a vulnerability for a specific entity

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Navigate to NRVM

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All entities** > Select the entity you wish to manage vulnerabilities > Under Triage click **Vulnerability Management** > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Select a vulnerability

        Click the vulnerability that you wish to mark as ignored. By default, this vulnerability view is filtered to only show vulnerabilities with the affected status.

        <img
        title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity"
        alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management"
        src={vmIgnoreEntityVulnList}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Change to ignored

        Click **Change to ignored** to begin the process of setting this vulnerability to ignored. Ignoring a vulnerability will hide it from default views and counts on this entity. Other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still remain Affected.

        <img
            title="Vulnerability instance details pages"
            alt="An image showing the change to ignored button on vulnerability instance details page"
            src={vmIgnoreEntityDetails}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Fill out form

        Fill out the form explaining the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability and the time period in which the vulnerability should remain Ignored. 

        When ignoring a vulnerability, you can select the reason behind the decision. One reason for ignoring a vulnerability is that the vulnerable code is not actually being used. When ignoring a vulnerability, you can provide details about your reasoning and a documentation link related to the investigation. 

        You can set the duration for this entity to be ignored. When the time period passes, Vulnerability Management will perform an automatic update setting it from ignored to affected. If an instance is already considered No Longer Detected, the status will remain no longer detected.

            title="Vulnerability instance details form"
            alt="An image showing the ignore form on vulnerability instance details page"
            src={vmIgnoreEntityForm}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Save the change

        Click **Save** when you are ready to submit the change of status. 
        
        Validate that the status has changed from affected to ignored. Notice that the changelog keeps a historical track of all modifications.

### Bulk ignoring a vulnerability 

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Navigate to NRVM

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All capabilities** > Select the **Vulnerability Management** tile > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Select a vulnerability

        Click the vulnerability that you wish to mark as ignored. By default, this vulnerability view is filtered to only show vulnerabilities where at least one entity is marked Affected.

        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Select the instances

        In the area of impact section, click the checkbox next to each entity that you wish to mark as ignored. Then click **Change to ignored** in the table header.

## Removing the ignored status (change to affected)

As time passes, it is good practice to review ignored vulnerabilities to validate if they should be addressed. A fix that was previously not available may become available or your threshold for addressing a vulnerability may change. To You can choose to set a vulnerability status back to affected on a per-entity basis.

### How to remove ignored status for a specific entity

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Navigate to NRVM

        Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > **All entities** > Select the entity you wish to manage vulnerabilities > Under Triage click **Vulnerability Management** > click the **Vulnerabilities** tab 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Change the filter

        By default, this view only shows instances of the vulnerability with the affected status.
        
        Click the filter **Status = Affected** and change it to **Ignored**. 

        Now only vulnerabilities with the ‘Ignored’ status will be visible.

        #### Find a vulnerability with ignored instances

        You can find ignored instances by clicking the **Settings Icon** and clicking the **Ignored** checkbox to add an ignore column to your vulnerability table.

        Now you can understand which vulnerabilies have instances ignored. Alternatively, you can change the status filter to **Ignored** to see vulnerabilities where all instances have been ignored.

        Select a vulnerability where the ignored count is greater than 0.
