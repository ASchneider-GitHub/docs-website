Frequent mobile app crashes significantly hinder the development lifecycle and degrade the user experience. The **group crashes** page provides a comprehensive solution for managing unanticipated exceptions, enabling development teams to:

* Analyze crash data: Review detailed crash reports and aggregated chart data.
* Track issue status: Monitor the progress of crash resolution from initial reporting to final fix.

This streamlined workflow accelerates the identification and resolution of critical issues, ultimately improving app stability and user satisfaction.

## Use the crash analysis workflow [#crash-workflow]

To get the most out of mobile monitoring's <DoNotTranslate>**Crash analysis**</DoNotTranslate> UI, use this basic workflow.

1. Start with the [<DoNotTranslate>**Crash rate percentage**</DoNotTranslate> and <DoNotTranslate>**Crash-free users percentage**</DoNotTranslate> charts](#percentage-charts) to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected [time period](#time-period).
1. Use the [groups and filters](#groups-filters) to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail.
1. Look for patterns in the [<DoNotTranslate>**Crash location**</DoNotTranslate> table](#reports-table) information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash.
1. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its [event trail](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/mobile-crash-event-trail), thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, [resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode](#export-xcode) so you can debug your source code more easily.
1. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as <DoNotTranslate>**Resolved**</DoNotTranslate>.
1. When finished, you have multiple options to set the status of your crash such as resolved, resolved in specific version, etc.

    Start with the <DoNotTranslate>**Crash rate percentage**</DoNotTranslate> and <DoNotTranslate>**Crash-free users percentage**</DoNotTranslate> charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example:

    * Are there any spikes near a recent version release?
    * Is there a [time period](#time-period) when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the <DoNotTranslate>**Crash-free users percentage**</DoNotTranslate> chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="groups-filters"
    title="Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data"
  >
    You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including:

    * Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes.
    * Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes.
    * Use the [time picker](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-time-picker) to adjust the currently selected time period.
    * Filter by a specific <DoNotTranslate>**Version**</DoNotTranslate> or by one or more attribute <DoNotTranslate>**Filter**</DoNotTranslate>, such as `Last Interaction`, `App Build`, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes).

      The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page.

## Crashes details view [#details-view]

When you select a crash group, a summary appears on the left panel, and detailed information on individual crashes is displayed on the right.

* Crash summary: crash summary contains aggregated information about all occurrences of this crash:
* Occurrences chart: A chart showing the number of occurrences of this particular crash over the selected time period since the first time the crash was detected
crash type: A chart showing the breakdown of operating system versions where this crash occurred or devices affected


Occurrences: If the mobile agent has collected more than one occurrence of the crash, you can paginate through each occurrence.

Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's [data retention policies](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-based-pricing/overview-data-retention-components/#mobile), you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information.

## Triage your crashes [#triage-crashes]

The triage section links the specific error occurrence you're viewing to a system-created error group that has a unique fingerprint for crashes. Why does that matter? That unique fingerprint enables you to triage an error group using a status update or assignment. The system-created error groups are the ones you find on the Triage tab. For more info on how they are generated, see How error groups work.

## Crash attributes [#crash-attributes]

Each crash sample provides details about the device where the crash occurred, including:

* App version: The application version where the crash occurred
* Device type: The specific device where the crash occurred
* OS version: The operating system version of the device
* RAM used: The amount of memory used by the application at the time of the crash
* Disk free: The amount of free disk space on the device at the time of the crash
* Attributes: Details about attributes related to the crash report which you can collapse or expand for deeper analysis

If applicable, you can export crash details to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code for easier debugging.

## Event trail [#event-trail]

https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/mobile-tab/#event-trail

The event trail shows all chronological event types that led up to a crash  based on your subscription level's data retention policy.These can be events New Relic monitors by default, or custom events. 

When a mobile app crashes and you don't know why, you can study what happened right before the crash. The crash event trail shows you these events so that you can follow the "breadcrumbs" leading up to the crash and diagnose the cause of the failure.

You can sort the event trail chronologically in both directions, though it defaults to showing the oldest event first, usually an App launch. Filter events by event type (i.e., Interaction, Request, or Request Error), reorder events ascending or descending timestamps, and click to expand each event to see more details on what happened. For example, if you want to investigate a Request event, you can expand on the event and look at responseTime and requestUrl.

The crash event trail shows all mobile event types leading up to a crash. You can use the Record breadkcrumb SDK to create custom MobileBreadcrumb events that track app activity you think would help you diagnose a crash.

You can also use MobileHandledException events in the crash event trail to aid in debugging. Use the iOS and Android recordHandledException SDK method to annotate where exceptions are handled in your application. These events will automatically appear in the crash event trail.

For more about annotating crash event trails with custom data, see Add custom data to mobile monitoring

## Mobile stack trace [#stack-trace]

The stack trace for the thread that generated the crashing exception appears below the crash details. Each frame of the stack shows the library or package name and the method associated with that stack frame.
The agent attempts to detect which frame of the stack contains the programming flaw responsible for the error. If detected, that stack frame appears red.
iOS apps will only show source code method names and line numbers if you have uploaded the dSYM for each build of your application.
Android apps using ProGuard will have the package and method names de-obfuscated if you have enabled ProGuard map uploading.
Android native crash reports will only show source filename and relative code offsets.


[Email alerts](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/mobile-monitoring-email-notifications/) promptly inform the team of new crashes. 

## Android-native crash reporting [#android-native-reporting]

Starting with [New Relic Android agent version 6.7.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-670), to help track and diagnose native crashes, reporting, and analysis has been enhanced to include signal violations and other faults that occur at the [native code](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides) level during runtime.

These enhancements include:

* Native crash reports - signal violations and other crashes reported by the app during runtime, including
  * Signal 4 (Illegal instruction)
  * Signal 6 (Abnormal termination)
  * Signal 7 (Bus error/bad memory access)
  * Signal 8 (Floating-point exception)
  * Signal 11 (Segmentation violation/invalid memory reference)

* Native runtime exceptions
The native agent will report any unhandled C++ exceptions thrown by the app during runtime, and report them as [handled exceptions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/introduction-mobile-handled-exceptions/). Unhandled exceptions are usually fatal and will crash the application.

* Application Not Responding (ANR) conditions
The native agent will detect and report [Application Not Responding](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr) conditions where an Activity or service thread has been blocked for longer than Android's allowable time, which is 5 seconds for foreground activities, and 5 to 200 seconds for services. ANR conditions will be reported as a [handled exception](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/introduction-mobile-handled-exceptions/) (rather than crashes), since these are not considered fatal conditions.

<Callout variant="important">
Native crash reporting is an incubating feature. Native crash monitoring is difficult at best, but the agent will make all best-attempts to detect and report these conditions. It may miss or incompletely report some conditions, and there may be latency viewing these conditions in the application dashboard.

Symbolication of native symbols will not be supported in early NDK agent releases. When native symbols for an app are not present, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not easily readable.
</Callout>

You can view detailed information about native crashes in New Relic Mobile's [<DoNotTranslate>**Crash analysis**</DoNotTranslate> UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes), or receive crash notifications by [email](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/receive-crash-notifications-email). You can also explore the crash data deeper with [New Relic Insights](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes#insights), or [integrate with ticketing systems](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/file-tickets-mobile-app-crashes) for further investigation.


Why are profiles disabled? 
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/mobile-tab/#profiles-disabled
Profiles are disabled when there are no statistically significant differences between attributes values of crashed and crash-free sessions or there are no profiles available that match the applied filters.
