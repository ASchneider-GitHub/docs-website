Request errors that occur because of either server issues or network failures can slow down your site, hinder performance, and affect the user experience. NewRelic’s Request Errors helps you understand where the HTTP Errors are originating from, as well as understand the reason behind network failures so that you can share actionable data with your team and solve these issues.

## View the Request Errors page [#request-errors-page]

To view the Request Errors page:
1. Go to one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Mobile > (select an app) > Request Errors
2. The Triage section creates system-created error groups that can be assigned to a user and it’s resolution can be tracked
3. The Group Request Errors section allows a user to analyze errors by allowing them to be grouped, sorted, and filtered based on their attributes

## Group Request Errors Tab [#group-request-errors-tab]

With the Request Errors page you can:
1. Assess overall HTTP and Network Request’s error trends:
    a. Obtain an overview of the request errors and the error rate occurring across multiple request domains, as well as across your mobile application's types and versions, to quickly identify and fix your API requests
2. Filter for deeper analysis: 
    a. Utilize groups and filters to focus on specific request attributes, such as the request type, request path, error type, or any custom attributes you have defined
3. Identify patterns: 
    a. Examine the Request Error table for trends related to request domains, request paths, and frequency of occurrence
4. Investigate individual request errors: 
    a. Select a request error report to view its distributed trace, event trail, response body, attributes, and other relevant details necessary for effective debugging
5. Update error status: 
    a. Mark the request error as 'Resolved' or assign it to a specific user on your team, who will then be responsible for owning and examining the issue and deploying a fix

## Suggested workflow [#suggested-workflow]

These steps outline our recommended approach to investigate HTTP request errors and network failures, enabling you to gain a complete understanding of the error, identify contributing factors, and implement effective debugging strategies.

1. Drill down into a single error 
    * To view details about a request error or network failure, click on the row from the error group table, here you can view the request information, request attributes, and response body as well as get more information about that error
2. Query and share error data 
    1. To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors page:
        1. Select … for any chart
        2. Select View query
    2. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink

	To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes:
        * MobileRequestError events and attributes
        * MobileRequest events and attributes
3. Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures
    * Make selections using both the Attributes and Filter bars. By default, the errors are grouped by request domain and request path
4. Filter for specific errors and network failures
    * Select an error or failure using  multiple filters from the Filter bar.
5. See which filters you applied or remove filters
    * The filters you select display in the filter bar. To clear filters, select the X next to the filter you want to clear
6. Change the time window
    * Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown
7. View information for one specific app version
    * Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown, by default all available versions will be selected

## Request error details view [#error-details]

The Request error details summary includes:
1. All Occurrences chart: 
    * This visualization displays the frequency of this request error over the selected period, from its initial detection onwards. It enables you to view either the aggregated data or a breakdown by app version
2. Error type breakdown: 
    * Displays the distribution of this request errors across different operating system versions or affected devices.

Resolved errors are indicated by a banner that shows the user who resolved the request error and the resolution timestamp. Note that mobile monitoring's data retention policies apply, allowing you to filter by resolved errors for historical analysis when needed.

## Error profiles [#error-profiles]

Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes:
* A heatmap showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most
* A label comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors

## Triage your errors [#triage-errors]

The triage section associates the specific error occurrence you are viewing with its [system-created error group](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#groups). These system-created error groups are identified by a unique fingerprint. It is this unique fingerprint that allows you to triage error groups by status updates or assignments.

For more info on how error groups are created, see [How error groups work](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#how-groups-work), and to learn more about status and assignments, see [Error tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#assign).

## Distributed trace [#distributed-trace]

The Distributed Trace section tracks and observes your requests as they flow through your application, traversing various services to reach completion. By visualizing the entire request path across different services, you can rapidly identify failures or performance bottlenecks.

To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see [Track requests across your microservices](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing/).

</figcaption>

## Response [#response]

A typical response to a request comprises a response header and response body, which together convey information about the success or failure of the request. The response header contains metadata about the server, while the response body holds information about the output, including a success or failure code and corresponding message.

New Relic captures the response body for requests whenever available, displaying it on the Request Error’s Details page to facilitate expedited debugging.

</figcaption>

## Event Trail [#event-trail]
 
The event trail provides a chronological log of all events leading up to the request error, aiding root cause analysis. These can be events New Relic monitors by default, or custom events. The event trail is sorted chronologically, beginning with the oldest event, which is typically the app launch, but you can modify the following:

* Sort: Toggle between ascending and descending order
* Event filtering: Filter by event type, like app launch, request, request error,  or user actions
* Event details: Expand individual events to inspect their attributes, like errorType, responseTime, or requestUrl for request events.

After you've sorted and filtered your events, you can dig a little deeper into the events that lead up to the error by examining:

* Custom breadcrumbs: 
    Utilize the [Record breadcrumb SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-breadcrumb/) to create custom MobileBreadcrumb events. This allows you to log specific application interactions that may be relevant to investigating your error.
* Handled exceptions: 
    Use the [Record Handled Exception SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-handled-exceptions/) methods for iOS and Android to annotate where exceptions are handled in your application. These annotations will automatically populate the crash event trail.

For detailed guidance on enhancing crash event trails with custom data, see [Record breadcrumbs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-breadcrumb/).

To fully leverage our crash analysis tools, make sure to:
1. Use the mobile SDK to create custom MobileBreadcrumb or MobileHandledException events.
2. Enable MobileRequest events for capturing network request data.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

* Keep in mind that profiles are disabled when there are no profiles available that match the applied filters
* Distributed trace for requests will most likely contain only one occurrence as it is a single HTTP event that is recorded in our system
* Network failures do not have response body
* The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page.

If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
