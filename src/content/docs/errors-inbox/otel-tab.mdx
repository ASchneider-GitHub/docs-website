With Group errors tab, you can dynamically filter and group errors for deeper analysis. Group errors shows you where your OpenTelemetry errors are happening, and provides tools to help you determine the root cause.

Your OpenTelemetry errors include spans where `otel.status_code = ERROR` and the `span.kind` is either server or consumer are treated as an individual error instance.

## Errors list view [#list-vew]

Start with the error rate charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, drips, or patterns with errors in general. 
Correlate any general pattern on the top 5 errors chart alerts occurring during the same period.
* **Dynamic grouping**: The default grouping for error occurrences is based on error.group.name and error.group.message. name, rpc.grpc.status_code, and error.type. You can change the grouping options by any attribute, up to five attributes at a time. The changes you make to the default grouping will be persisted. 
* **Filtering**:  Many New Relic customers instrument custom attributes. Filtering on a specific custom attribute can quickly cut through the noise of all error occurrences. 

## Error profiles [#profiles]

Error profiles can help you answer questions like, which users were most common across all the error events during the selected time window? You can download the attributes as CSV. You can also view the attributes breakdown when you select a row.

## Error details view [#details-view]
On this page, you can dive deep into a specific error group. Error groups are sets of unique error instances that share a unique fingerprint. 

For example, if you've identified a group of hosts causing an error spike, the detailed view provides in-context details. From the detailed view, you can cycle through specific errors using the toggle in the upper right to navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, or any example between. 

## Occurrences tab [#occurrences]
The Occurrences tab includes error frequency, occurrence details, and stack traces. You can also dig deeper by viewing triage information and related distributed traces.

### Triage section [#triage]
The triage section links the specific error occurrence to a system-created error group with a unique fingerprint. Why does that matter? That unique fingerprint enables you to triage an error group using a status update or assignment. The system-created error groups are the ones you find on the Triage tab. For more info on how they are generated, see How error groups work.

## Distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing]
If you've set up distributed tracing, and if there are sampled traces related to errors, you'll see options to view trace details. This is a quick way to view trace information without going to the main distributed tracing page.
