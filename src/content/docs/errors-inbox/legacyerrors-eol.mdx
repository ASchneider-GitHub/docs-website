We're excited to introduce a new and improved errors experience, designed to provide a more comprehensive and intuitive way to manage errors in your applications. To ensure a smooth transition, please take note of the following important updates:

## Important Dates:

* **January 31, 2024:** The legacy errors experience will be discontinued.
* **Switch Now!** Access the new experience today by selecting the Show new view option.

## Agent Updates Required

Certain older agent versions do not produce `TransactionError` events, which are necessary for the new experience. To ensure full functionality, please update to the following minimum agent versions or higher:

* Ruby:  3.14.0.305
* PHP: 5.1.130
* .NET:  6.8.172.0
* Java: 3.21.0
* Python:  2.58.0.43
* Node.js: 1.24.0
* Go: 0.5.0

## Stack Trace Visibility

In some cases, you may find that a stack trace is viewable in the legacy experience but not in the new one. This is due to a bookmarking feature that preserves certain stack traces beyond their standard retention period, but only if they were previously viewed in the legacy experience.

To ensure access to these bookmarked stack traces in the new experience, please update your agent to the latest version.

* Golang: 3.28.1
* Ruby: 9.6.0
* Java: 8.7.0

## Upgrade for the Best Experience

We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest agent versions to take full advantage of the new errors experience.

For detailed instructions on updating agents, please refer to [our documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).
