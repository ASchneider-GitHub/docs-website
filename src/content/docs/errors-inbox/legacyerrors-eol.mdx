We're excited to introduce a new and improved errors experience, designed to provide a more comprehensive and intuitive way to manage errors in your applications. To ensure a smooth transition, please take note of the following important updates:

## Important Dates:

* **January 31, 2024:** The legacy errors experience will be discontinued.
* **Switch Now!** Access the new experience today by selecting the Show new view option.

## Agent Updates Required

Certain older agent versions do not produce `TransactionError` events, which are necessary for the new experience. To ensure full functionality, please update to the following minimum agent versions or higher:

* Ruby:  3.14.0.305
* PHP: 5.1.130
* .NET:  6.8.172.0
* Java: 3.21.0
* Python:  2.58.0.43
