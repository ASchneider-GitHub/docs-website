New Relic's Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding simplifies sending logs from your cluster to New Relic logs. It uses a standalone Docker image and runs as a DaemonSet, seamlessly collecting logs for centralized analysis and troubleshooting. Forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic will give you enhanced l<InlinePopover type="logs" /> capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Enable Kubernetes for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your Kubernetes logs to New Relic with our plugin:

1. Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration following the steps from [this page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/). This integration includes the Kubernetes plugin for logs.
2. Optionally, you can further tune your installation in [Step 4 from the guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#kubernetes-install-navigation) using the numerous configuration options available in the [newrelic-logging repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.

  <Callout variant="important">

  If you're [using a Kubernetes secret](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging/values.yaml#L8-L25) to store the New Relic license key, the `newrelic-logging` chart defaults to sending logs to the US API endpoint. If the license key belongs to an EU or FedRAMP account, and a secret is used for key storage, you must update the endpoint setting with the appropriate value from the [API reference docs](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint). Here's an example of how to set this for EU accounts:

  ```
  newrelic-logging:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1
  ```
  </Callout>

3. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## Troubleshoot your Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding installation

Sometimes, despite correctly installing the Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding (`newrelic-logging` [Helm chart](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging)), you may encounter performance issues that affect the correct delivery of logs. In such circumstances, it can be helpful to look at the log forwarder ([Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)) internal metrics to understand what is the cause of a potential bottleneck.

To this end, the `newrelic-logging` Helm chart provides a configuration setting to enable the collection of such metrics for a given Kubernetes cluster. Moreover, we provide a dashboard template in JSON format to easily display all these metrics in New Relic.

To configure your Kubernetes cluster to send the log forwarder internal metrics and represent them in a dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Install the Helm chart with the following extra configuration setting:
```
  newrelic-logging:
    fluentBit:
      sendMetrics: true
  ```
2. Download this dashboard template file. Open it in a text editor and replace all the `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` occurrences (42 in total) by your [New Relic Account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/).

3. Import the resulting dashboard in JSON format by following [these instructions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#import-json).

4. The imported dashboard will be available in your [Dashboards page](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards) as `Kubernetes Fluent Bit monitoring`.

5. (Optional) It is highly recommended to enable [facet filtering] based on the "Fluent Bit version" table. To do so, simply click on the "Edit" submenu of the "Fluent Bit version" table and select "Filter the current dashboard" under "Facet Linking".

<Callout variant="tip">
  We capture Fluent Bit's internal metrics by using its [prometheus_scrape INPUT plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/prometheus-scrape-metrics) in conjunction with its [prometheus_remote_write OUTPUT plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/prometheus-remote-write). All the Prometheus `counter` metrics are actually _cumulative counters_, but we automatically perform a _delta conversion_ when they are ingested at New Relic to ease querying them using NRQL later. You can find more details [here](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/cumulative-metrics/).

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, you can uninstall the Kubernetes plugin by following the steps outlined [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
