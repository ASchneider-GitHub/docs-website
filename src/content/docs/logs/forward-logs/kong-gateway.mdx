Forwarding Kong Gateway logs to New Relic provides valuable insights into API gateway performance, health, security, and usage. This document outlines the process of using the File Log plugin to forward logs from Kong Gateway to New Relic.

## Prerequisites

* Kong Gateway with installed [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)] (https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/plugins/rate-limiting/#install-the-gateway-apis)
* [Kubernetes plugin] (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/) installed 

## Configuration Overview [#config-overview]

The File Log plugin for Kong Gateway enables the forwarding of logs to New Relic by directing them to standard output (/dev/stdout). This setup allows NewRelic's Kubernetes logging plugin integration to collect and forward the logs.

## Configuration Setup: [#config-setup]

## Step 1: Install the New Relic Kubernetes Logging Integration 

Before configuring the File Log plugin, ensure you have the New Relic Kubernetes logging integration installed. Follow the [instructions] (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/) to set this up.

## Step 2: Install and Configure Kong File Log Plugin

Once the New Relic Logging integration is installed, configure the File Log to output logs to /dev/stdout. 

Here is an example manifest for enabling the File Log plugin:

```yaml
# file-log-plugin.yaml
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongClusterPlugin
metadata:
 name: global-file-log
 annotations:
   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: kong
 labels:
   global: "true"
config:
 path: "/dev/stdout"
plugin: file-log
```

## Step 3: Apply the Log File Log plugin Configuration

Deploy the File Log plugin configuration to your Kubenrnetes cluster using the following command. 

  ```
     kubectl apply -f file-log-plugin.yaml -n kong
  ```

Replace `file-log-plugin.yaml` with the actual filename of your manifest

## Step 4: Verify the Configuration [#find-data]

After applying the configuration, verify that logs are being forwarded to New Relic by checking the New Relic Logs UI for entries from Kong Gateway

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data).

For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```
