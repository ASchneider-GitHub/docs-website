Live archives allows you to store logs for as long as you need. New Relic has a thirty-day retention for logs by default, but with live archives, you can extend that period for up to seven years. Like old tax documents, sometimes you don't need your data close at hand, but it's safe to keep the information available for reference if needed.

Is live archives for you? Here are some example use cases:

* **HIPAA compliance**: Companies must store data for a year or longer to be HIPAA compliant.
* **SOX compliance**:  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that all public companies keep logs for a year, but most companies store that data for thirteen months.
* **Trends and long-term debugging**: Long term log storage can help improve year-over-year performance. For example, if you manage a retail company, comparing logs from one holiday season to the next can improve performance.

## How live archives works [#how-it-works]

The live archives feature offers long-term log data storage that you intend to query sparingly for a lower storage cost. With live archives, you can have peace of mind knowing your logs are available during an audit or for long-term debugging, but you will only be charged for the service when you _query old data_.

## Get started
<Steps>
<Step>
### Enable live archives [#enable]

Before you can query live archives, you need to edit your data retention. 

1. On the **Data retention** UI page, located in the [data management hub](https://one.newrelic.com/data-management-hub) select **Edit data retention**.
2. Scroll down to **Logging live archives** and enter the days you'd like your data stored. For example, if you want to be SOX compliant, we recommend 396 days.
3. Click **Apply changes**.

Keep in mind that you will need Admin capabilities to edit data retention.

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a partition using live archives [#partitions]

A partition is a way to group logs based on specific criteria. Creating partitions can help ensure data privacy compliance. Let's say you need to store certain logs to be HIPAA compliant, you can create a partition to filter out the logs you don't need and keep the ones you do with live archives. 

1. Go to **one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Logs**.
2. To the left of the logs query bar, click **Data partitions**, then click **Create data partition**.
3. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_.
4. Select the field "Use live archives on this partition."
5. The **Total effective retention** days will be updated to reflect the regular retention _and_ the [live archives retention](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives-costs/#what-counts).

</Step>

<Step>
### Query live archives [#query]

There are two ways to query live archives: with Lucene or NRQL. If you want to use logs syntax that you're familiar with outside of New Relic, we suggest querying in the **Logs** UI. 

1. Go to **one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Logs**.
2. Select the dates you'd like to query.
3. Using the search bar, run your desired query. 
4. A screen will show you that you're about to query live archives. Querying live archives is more expensive, so only select **Query live archives** if you're ready.

<figcaption>
    Go to **one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Logs** to query data stored with live archives.

</Step>

<Step>
### Query live archives with NRQL [#nrql]

If you want to query using the same language you use for errors inbox or alerts, we suggest querying in NRQL.

1. Go to **one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Logs**.
2. Enter the NRQL query you want to run.
3. Toggle **Use live archives**.
4. A screen will show you that you're about to query live archives. Querying live archives is more expensive, so only select **Query live archives** if you're ready.

<figcaption>
    Go to **one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Logs**, then select **NRQL** to query data stored with live archives using the query builder.

</Step>

<Step>
### See your data consumption [#data-consumtion]

Live archives is billed differently than the rest of your logs. You can read more about it in our [Live archives storage: Billing and rules documentation](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives-costs/). Once you query live archives, you can explore your data consumption in the [data management hub](https://one.newrelic.com/data-management-hub).

1. Select **Compute management**.
2. Scroll down to **Product capabilities**. 
3. Select **Logs**.
4. You can filter for users, accounts, or capabilities. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Data deletion [#delete]

If at any point you want to reduce your data retention, please note: 

* You will need Admin privileges to edit data retention.
* You cannot recover data if you reduce data retention later. 
* Your data deletion is effective on the day you reduce your retention. 
* You can request that your data be deleted for any given set of days. All live archives data for the selected dates will be deleted.
* Deletion requests should be made the day +/-1 day.
* Days start and end on UTC boundaries.
