View your logs with ANSI colors in the Logs UI! To get started, ingest logs with ANSI color codes attached to a log attribute. Ensure that proper unicode escape characters are used when sending in ANSI color codes. Here's an example:

```
{ 
  message: "\u001b[36m Sample ANSI message \u001b[0m",
  logType: "sample"
}
``` 

Once the logs are ingested with these attributes, the **Logs** UI will display your log lines with their respective ANSI colors.


## How it works [#how-works]

When an ANSI log line is ingested by the agent, that log line is parsed and displayed automatically in the log table with the ANSI codes respected. You do not need to add additional parsing rules. 

As long as the forwarded logs' attribute values have an ANSI code in them, the log table will display them. If no ANSI color codes are supplied at ingest, then the log line will be displayed in the default color in the log table.
