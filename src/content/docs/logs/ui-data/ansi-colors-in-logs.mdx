View your logs with ANSI colors in the Logs UI! To get started, ingest logs with ANSI color codes attached to a log attribute. Ensure that proper unicode escape characters are used when sending in ANSI color codes.

Example log: 

```
{ 
  message: "\u001b[36m Sample ANSI message \u001b[0m",
  logType: "sample"
}
``` 

Once the logs are ingested, go to the **Logs UI** to see your log lines with their respective ANSI colors.
