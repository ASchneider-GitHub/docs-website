New Relic alerts are built with alert conditions. If you want to be notified of any unusual behavior in your stack, you'll first need to create an alert condition. An alert condition is essentially a container that you create to define what conditions need to be met before you're notified of any unusual behavior. There are a few ways of creating alert conditions, but the easiest way is to create an alert condition from a chart and we've provided a step-by-step guide in our [Create your first alert doc](docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/). You can use our **Alert conditions** page to keep track of all your alert conditions. 

With our alert conditions page you can:
* Browse all of your alert conditions and easily see if there are any open issues
* Open an existing alert conditions to edit thresholds or signal behavior 
* Create a new alert condition 

From the Alerts & AI Alert Conditions, by clicking on a conditions name you’ll be able to see a detailed look at a condition. The Overview allows you to take a look at a condition’s Query, Signal coverage, Signal behavior, Thresholds as well as additional details.

In addition to those sections, you can also see entity information like tags and metadata, as well as a Code Preview (‘View as code’ button) that allows you to preview the condition as Terraform or NerdGraph code.

Each section includes a button to ‘Edit’ that part of the condition in the top right of the card.

## Signal Coverage [#signal-coverage]

Signal Coverage gives a closer look at the most recent signals being ingested by the condition. For Synthetics type conditions, a chart is shown with the 5 most recent SyntheticChecks. For all other types, a line chart showing the NraiSignal over time for the last few days is shown for easier analysis. This chart is similar to what is shown for an individual Issue or Incident.

If a condition is disabled, you’ll see an empty state message in this section of the Overview. In the case where the condition is not receiving a signal, you will see an error message prompting you to adjust your condition settings.

## Signal Behavior [#signal-behavior]
Signal Behavior will list the Advanced Signal Settings of the condition.

## Thresholds [#thresholds]
This section will show your Thresholds this condition uses for opening an incident. 

## Additional Details
This section gives the rest of the details added during initial configuration of the Condition, as well as a link to the associated Policy.
