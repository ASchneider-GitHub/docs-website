CodeStream sends email notifications when new [transaction-level anomalies](/docs/codestream/observability/transactions) are found in services that are built from your code. Select the <DNT>**Notifications**</DNT> option under the username menu at the top of the CodeStream pane to control which repositories and services you'll be notified about, or to turn off notifications completely.

By default, you will automatically be following any repository that you open in your IDE. You can alternatively decide to manually follow repositories. Under this model you can follow a repository by opening it in your IDE, then hovering over its entry in the CodeStream tree view and clicking on the Follow icon.

You can unfollow a repository by visiting the <DNT>**Notification Settings**</DNT> page and clicking the "X" to the right of any repository that you're current following.

By default, you will be notified about anomalies in any of the services associated with the repositories that you're following. You may, however, only want to get notifications for a subset of these services. For example, you might only want notifications for your production services. You can limit the services by specifying a keyword present in the service name (e.g., "prod"), a list of account IDs, or a set of key:value pairs (e.g., environment:production).
