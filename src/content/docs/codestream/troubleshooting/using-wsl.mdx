To use CodeStream and WSL on Windows, follow these few steps -

1. Git must be installed on the Windows machine, as well as in your WSL distro
  i. While the versions installed between the two could differ, its best to ensure the Windows version matches whatever is installed in your WSL distro
1. Clone your git repo into your WSL distro (for example, <DNT>`~/code/<project>`</DNT>)
1. On Windows, you'll need to allow git to communicate over this UNC path by marking the directory as 'safe', using the following command in your Windows terminal:
  i. <DNT>`git config --global --add safe.directory '//wsl.localhost/<distro>/home/<username>/code/<project>'`</DNT> (replace <DNT><distro>, <username>, and <project></DNT> to match your configuration)
    i. For example, if I had Ubuntu and my username there is 'codestream', my UNC path would be <DNT>`//wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/codestream/code/<project>`</DNT>
  ii. Git on Windows is only used to make requests to your locally cloned repo in WSL and doesn't need to communicate with the remote (i.e., GitHub, GitLab, etc.).  
1. In your IDE, open the project using the WSL UNC path (for example, <DNT>`//wsl.localhost/<distro>/home/<username>/code/<project>`</DNT>)

At this point, if you're still experiencing issues, please [collect your log files](/docs/codestream/troubleshooting/client-logs) and contact New Relic customer support for further investigation.
