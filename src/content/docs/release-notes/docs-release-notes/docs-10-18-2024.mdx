### New docs

* [Forward Kong Gateway logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kong-gateway/) describes how to install and use this new log forwarding plugin via the Kubernetes integration.
* [Azure App Service monitoring](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/azure/monitoring-azure-app-service/) describes how to integrate this Azure service with New Relic and links out to instructions on how to set this up for our Java, .NET, Node.js, and Python APM agents.

### Major changes

* We've migrated content from our Open Source site to our docs site.

### Minor changes

* In [OpenTelemetry metrics in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-metrics/#otlp-summary), we've clarified that OpenTelemetry summary metrics aren't supported.
* Updated a screenshot in [recommended alert policies and dashboards](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/recommended-alert-policies/#add-recommended-alert-policy) to clarify where to find the Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine tiles.
* Deleted Stackato and WebFaction docs related to the Python APM agent, because they're no longer relevant.
* Added a new browser monitoring endpoint to our [Networks](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#new-relic-endpoints) doc.
