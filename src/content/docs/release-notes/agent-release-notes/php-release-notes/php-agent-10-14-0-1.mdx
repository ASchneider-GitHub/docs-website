## New Relic PHP agent v10.14.0.1

### Security

* Updated the Golang version used to build the Daemon from 1.20 to 1.21.1.

### New features

* The PHP agent now supports APM log context attributes.  See the (PHP Logs In Context)[https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#logs-in-context] page for more information.

* The agent now supports detecting Docker container IDs via cgroup v2.

### Bug Fixes

* A fix was added that removes erroneous deprecation warnings which could appear using the mysqli extension with PHP 8.1 and later.

* When PHP8+ is built in debug mode, zpp/arginfo mismatches are now Fatal Errors. Fixed the mismatches that existed in the code base.

### Important end-of-life information

* Support for PHP versions 7.0 and 7.1 will **EOL** in early 2024.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [PHP EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
**For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform, it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and the removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.
The PHP agent packages that are affected are:
   - newrelic-php5
   - newrelic-php5-common
   - newrelic-daemon
