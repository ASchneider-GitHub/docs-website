## Notes

This release of the Python agent updates the NewRelicLogForwardingHandler to support dictionary type logs and apply formatting and fixes a bug in struct log so that it handles processors of all iterable types.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).


## New features

* **Support dict type logs and formatting in NewRelicLogForwadingHandler**
    Adds support for dictionary type logs and now applies formatting before recording the log.


## Bug fixes

* **Fix bug in struct log**
    Previously there was a bug in the struct log instrumentation where processors was assumed to be list type. Now the instrumentation supports processors of all iterable types.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.
