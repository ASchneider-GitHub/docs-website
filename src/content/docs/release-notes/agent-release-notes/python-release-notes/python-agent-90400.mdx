## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for nonced content security policies for Browser Agent injection, adds new wheels for Python 3.12 and musl Linux systems such as Alpine, deprecates the ObjectWrapper and `get_browser_timing_footer` APIs, fixes a crash with Kafka instrumentation when using distributed tracing, and removes a case sensitive header check in `ASGIBrowserMiddleware`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Deprecate `newrelic.agent.ObjectWrapper` API**
Removes custom `newrelic.agent.ObjectWrapper` implementation and instead creates a pass through to `wrapt.FunctionWrapper`.

* **Deprecate `get_browser_timing_footer` API**
Previously `get_browser_timing_footer` was an API that would be used to supply information to the Browser Agent loaded by `get_browser_timing_header`. This step is now included in `get_browser_timing_header` making `get_browser_timing_footer` obsolete. This function now returns an empty string to avoid breaking existing applications.

## New features

* **Add nonced content security policies (CSPs) for Browser Agent injection**
The Browser Agent injection API `get_browser_timing_header` has a new parameter `nonce` that takes a cryptographic nonce for use with content security policies. The nonce will be automatically inserted into the generated HTML.

* **Add additional wheel options for Python 3.12 and musl Linux**
Add pre-built binary wheel support for Python 3.12, as well as alternative wheels for musl based Linux operating systems (such as Alpine).

* **Add `newrelic.agent.CallableObjectProxy` to public APIs**
Previously `CallableObjectProxy` was never exposed for general use with custom instrumentation, but was present in internal modules used by the agent. This API has been added to `newrelic.agent.CallableObjectProxy` for general use.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix a crash with [kafka-python](https://pypi.org/project/kafka-python/) and [confluent-kafka](https://pypi.org/project/confluent-kafka/) when using distributed tracing**
Previously Kafka instrumentation packages would sometimes fail to generate distributed tracing headers and cause a crash. This has been fixed and distributed tracing headers should now generate correctly.

* **Remove case sensitive header check in `ASGIBrowserMiddleware`**
The agent previously only supported HTML insertion for headers that were lowercase in ASGI applications. The header check is now case insensitive in compliance with the ASGI specification.
