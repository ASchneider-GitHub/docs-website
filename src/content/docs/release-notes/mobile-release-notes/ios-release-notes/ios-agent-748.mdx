## Fixed in this release

* Fixed Async requests to show up in Distributed Tracing
* Added New `NRFeatureFlag_NewEventSystem` feature flag. Enable this flag to use our new, more stable, new event system for iOS agent.
```
    NewRelic.enableFeatures([NRMAFeatureFlags.NRFeatureFlag_NewEventSystem])
```

### Other notes

* With the 7.4.6 release the dsym-upload-tools are no longer included inside the XCFramework. The dsym-upload-tools are available in the `dsym-upload-tools` folder of the `https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm` Swift Package Manager repository. Please copy this dsym-upload-tools directory to your applications source code directory if you are integrating the New Relic iOS Agent by copying XCFramework into project or using cocoapods.

Please use the run script below in your Xcode build phases to perform symbol upload steps during app builds in Xcode.
```
ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}"
SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
/bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
```

* Swift Package Manager is the preferred installation method.

### Support statement

* As of iOS agent version 7.4.1, the iOS agent will consolidate previously separate XCFramework and tvOS agents into a singular iOS agent. 
* As of this release, the oldest supported version of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/xcframework-agent-732) is 7.3.2.
