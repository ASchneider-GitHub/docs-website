## New

### Adds configurable header instrumentation to network requests

The agent will now produce network event attributes if it detects request header values
that are passed into the agent when started. For more information, see the [Mobile documentation]().

### Adds GraphQL attributes to network requests

If the agent detects headers from Apollo GraphQL servers, it will add additional attributes to the
network request event. For more information, see the [Mobile documentation]().

* Exclude instrumentation by package name

The agent plugin can now be configured to exclude classes from a specific package space
during instrumentation. These classes will be unmodified. This feature can be useful when 
encountering sensitive or problematic class data.

For more information, see the [Configure the New Relic Gradle plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-new-relic-gradle-plugin/). 

## Fixed
* Exclude signed jars from instrumentation
