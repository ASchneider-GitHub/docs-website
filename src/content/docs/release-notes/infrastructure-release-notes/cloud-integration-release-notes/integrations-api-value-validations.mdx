### Updates to Cloud Integrations API Validations

The following changes are happening for requests on NerdGraph under the `cloud` namespace on Integrations configuration parameter fields to prevent requests that are confusing in its effects.

* The validations for boolean fields have been updated. From now on, null values will be rejected for these fields.
* The inventory polling interval and metrics polling interval integer fields have been updated as well. Going forward, these fields will no longer accept null values.
* The tagKey parameter under GCP, AWS integrations will no longer accept empty strings as value.

Please ensure that you provide valid values for these fields in your requests.
