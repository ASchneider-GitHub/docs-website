Agentless monitoring and standardized entity creation across EC2, azure VMs, and GCP CE is now available. 

## New 

We updated our cloud host monitoring capabilities to help you monitor your Amazon EC2, Azure VM, and GCP CE instances more effectively. You'll now have access to:

* Enhanced visibility into your Amazon EC2, Azure VM, and GCP CE infrastructure without the need for complex setup or configuration
* Simplified set-up that eliminates manual agent installations and configuration 

New Relic can detect your cloud host instances, create entities for them, and provide comprehensive insight into each hostâ€™s performance, resource utilization, and health.
