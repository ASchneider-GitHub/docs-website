## Notes

* Adds local testing for Extension. Local testing is enabled by setting `NEWRELIC_LOCAL_TESTING` to true. Currently it supports only Python runtime. It generates the lambda layers for `x86` and `arm` architectures layers, using `publish.sh` script and invokes the test Lambdas using `test.sh` script.

* Removes `SSM parameter store` calls. Extension has sanitycheck calls to `SSM store` that adds to production quotas for customers. Call `SSM store` only when `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_SSM_PARAMETER_NAME` var is set to `true`.

* Adds timeout for calls to `Secrets Manager` & `SSM Parameter Store`.

* Gives priority to `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and bypass calls to `Secrets Manager` if `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is set.

* Handle Extension Warning for Node.js handlers using ES Modules. Even after accurately modifying the lambda handler to use newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler and setting the environment variable NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER to be path to the initial handler, Extension was throwing warning. Used NEW_RELIC_USE_ESM to understand that customer is using ES module.
