version: 2.3.13

## Notes

* Introduces support for Ruby Lambda runtime.

* Adds tags for logs, and introduces environment variable to configure custom attributes or other metadata when sending logs directly using extension. Use `NR_TAGS` & `NR_ENV_DELIMITER` environment variables similar to the `log-ingestion-lambda` to add metadata to the logs.

* Removes debug logs which get printed for each log line. Modifies confusing message log - mainLoop: blocking is confusing customer and adds payloadSize to the log message `Telemetry client error: %s, payload size: %d bytes"`.

* Updates on .NET Extension example to use newly released New Relic .NET lambda layer instead of OpenTracing.

* Updates on readme build step. Updated target for make command, example `make dist-x86_64` and `make dist-arm64`.

## Fixed issues

* Fixed `NR_EXT` log lines. The extension will not print any `NR_EXT` lines when `logsEnabled` is false, including the startup line.
