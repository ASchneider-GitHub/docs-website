## Notes

* Adds a feature to ignore Extension Startup Checks using the Lambda environment variable `NEW_RELIC_IGNORE_EXTENSION_CHECKS`. One can ignore selected Extension Checks by using a comma-separated value. For example, `agent,handler` will ignore agent and handler Extension Checks. Use `all` to ignore all Extension Checks. It is recommended to ignore `all` Extension Checks after the Lambda function has been successfully instrumented.

* Update information about environment variable `NR_TAGS` in the Readme. `NR_TAGS` can be used to add tags to all the lambda log events.

* Introduce support for `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED` Environment variable which is used to disable Agent. The `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED` is set to env bool type.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed docker handler warning issue for containerized lambda
