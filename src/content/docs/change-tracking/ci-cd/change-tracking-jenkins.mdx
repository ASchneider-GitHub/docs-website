The change tracking feature allows you to designate changes you want to monitor to see how they affect your customers and systems.

While you can designate which changes you want to monitor by using GraphQL or our CLI, you can also record changes using pipelines in Jenkins.

A pipeline will call whatever build you specify and also pass additional environment variables to the build process. This populates the data that is needed for your deployment to show up in charts across New Relic. You'll see the results in the change tracking UIs, and you can use this information to understand the impact of changes on entity health.

Before you get started make sure you're using Jenkins 1.580.1 or newer. 

## Manage the plugin [#install-remove]

To record changes you want to track, you need a plugin, which you can easily add or remove from your Jenkins instance.

Complete the following steps as a Jenkins administrator.

### Add the plugin [#add-plugin]

To add the plugin:

1. Open Jenkins, and click **Manage Jenkins**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsHomePage}
    />
2. Click **Manage Plugins**.

    <img
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
      title="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Plugins"
      alt="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Plugins"
      src={trackingJenkinsManage}
    />
3. Click **Available**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing the Advanced button in Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing the Advanced button in Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsAdvanced}
    />
4. Search for **newrelic-deployment-notifier**. On that row, click the `Install` checkbox, then click the `Install` button. 

5. A new page appears, showing you the progression of the installation. **No restart needed**. 

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing the box to restart Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing the box to restart Jenkins"
      src={trackingRestartJenkins}
    />

### Remove the Plugin [#remove-plugin]

To remove the plugin using Plugin Manager:

1. Click **Installed**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot of the Installed tab in Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot of the Installed tab in Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsInstalledTab}
    />
2. Roll it back to the previous version by entering deploy in the search box, selecting **New Relic Deployment Notifier Plugin**, and then clicking the rollback symbol.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing the rollback button"
      alt="Screenshot showing the rollback button"
      src={trackingJenkinsRollback}
    />
3. You can also uninstall it by clicking the **X** icon.

## Create Post-build Action [#create-post--build-action]

Use the New Relic Deployment Notifier by adding it as a Post-build Action in your Jenkins build job configuration.


1. In your Jenkins job configuration go to the **Post-build Actions section**, click on **Add post-build action** and select **New Relic Deployment Notifications**. 


    <img
      style={{ align: "left" }}
      title="Screenshot showing the Add post-build action button, with the dropdown menu showing New Relic Deployment Notifications"
      alt="Screenshot showing the Add post-build action button, with the dropdown menu showing New Relic Deployment Notifications"
      src={trackingJenkinsAddPostBuildAction}
    />
2. Create a username/password credential for the User [API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). Enter the key as the password. 

    <img
      style={{ align: "left" }}
      title="Screenshot showing credential creation dialog"
      alt="Screenshot showing credential creation dialog"
      src={trackingJenkinsAddCredential}
    />
3. Select an entity in the dropdown list. 

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
      src={trackingJenkinsSelectEntity}
    />
4. Add the required `Version` or `Revision` value, and any of the optional values. **Tip:** You can [use environment variables](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables) in these fields, like `${BUILD_NUMBER}`. 

    <img
      style={{ align: "left" }}
      title="Screenshot showing optional fields"
      alt="Screenshot showing optional fields"
      src={trackingJenkinsOptionalFields}
    />

            The user conducting the deployment. **Tip:** You can install [Build User Vars Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Build+User+Vars+Plugin) to have environment variables regarding the Jenkins user, and can use them in this field, like `${BUILD_USER}`. 

            <img

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
5. It is possible to configure several applications to be notified. 

    <img
      style={{ align: "left" }}
      title="Screenshot showing button Add another notification"
      alt="Screenshot showing button Add another notification"
      src={trackingJenkinsAddAnotherNotification}
    />
6. Don't forget to `Save` the change! Deployments will now be sent every time this build job is done. 


## What's next [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).
