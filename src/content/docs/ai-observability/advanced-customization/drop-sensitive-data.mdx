Our agents collect and store your data in the New Relic database (NRDB). When an agent captures an interaction with your AI assistant, it stores the contents of those prompts and responses as text string attributes within data events. This gives you greater insight into the cost, accuracy, and performance of your AI-powered app, but you may not want to store interactions that contain sensitive data.

Drop rules let you remove sensitive data before the agent forwards it to NRDB. A drop rule directs the agent to drop certain attributes if the text string within the attribute matches the regex. This lets you still analyze an interaction with your AI assistant without storing your customer's personal data in our databases. 

## Create drop filters [#create-filter]

A single drop rule targets a specified attribute within one event type, but sensitive information from a single AI interaction is stored in multiple events. To ensure that information is completely dropped before it enters NRDB, you need four separate drop rules.

      title="Create a drop filter"
      alt="When you click Create a drop filter, a side modal appears to guide you through dropping text from events and attributes."
      src={aiDropFilterModal}
  />

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > AI monitoring > Drop filters**, then click **Create drop filter**. 
1. Create a filter name. Because one kind of data requires four drop rules, we recommend a naming convention that helps you track the events you're dropping data from. 
1. Paste in the base NRQL query:
  ```sql
  SELECT <COLUMN> FROM <EVENT_TYPE> WHERE <COLUMN> RLIKE <REGEX>
  ```
1. Referring to the table, update the `<COLUMN>` and `<EVENT_TYPE>` placeholders to match the attributes and events. For example:
  ```sql
  SELECT content FROM LlmChatCompletionMessage WHERE content RLIKE <REGEX>
  ```
1. Add the regex that corresponds to the kind of information you want to drop. For example, if you're targeting IP addresses, the completed query should read:
  ```sql
  SELECT content FROM LlmChatCompletionMessage WHERE content RLIKE ^([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})$
  ```
1. Repeat the above steps to create drop filters for the remaining events and column pairs. 

## Your data compliance responsibilities [#responsibilities]

New Relic can't guarantee that this functionality completely resolves your data disclosure concerns, nor can we provide support for building out your NRQL queries. We recommend that you:

* Review your drop rules and confirm they're accurately identifying and discarding the data you want dropped.
* Check that your drop rules are still dropping sensitive information after you've created them. 

While drop rules ensure that personal information about your end users aren't stored in NRDB, creating the rules themselves imply the kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems. This is important when determining control permissions for certain users in your org, as certain permissions let users view and edit all information in the rules you create.

## How drop filters work [#drop-rules-work]

A drop filter directs the agent to drop information if it meets a set of conditions. A drop filter contains three parts:

* Events: A stored record from an interaction within your system.
* Attributes, or columns: A key-value pair attached to data objects. 
* Regex: A string of characters and operators that corresponds to kinds of information. 

### Events and attributes 

In a typical AI interaction, a prompt or request undergoes certain processes (like embedding) that are recorded as discrete events. For example, let's say a customer requests a street address on file. The prompt is processed by the model, which pulls additional context through various services and databases. Your AI assistant then returns with a response that contains the requested information. 

Below are the different events that occur in a system in an interaction like this: 

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Event
            </th>
            <th>
                Attribute, or column 
            </th>
            <th>
                Description 
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                `LlmChatCompletionMessage`
            </td>
            <td>
                `content`
            </td>
            <td>
                Describes when your model generates text to be delivered to your end user. For example, a completion event is triggered when the model generates a text response containing the address. The final message appers as the value for the attribute `content`.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                `LlmFeedbackMessage`
            </td>
            <td>
                `messages`
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                `LlmEmbedding`
            </td>
            <td>
                `input`
            </td>
            <td>
                Indicates when your model uses a vector to interpret words and sentences. It appears when the LLM processes the prompt for the address and again when the model generates the response. The data appears as the value for the attribute `input`. 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                `LlmTool`
            </td>
            <td>
                `input` / `output`
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

A complete set of drop filters for a piece of sensitive information should include queries for four events: `LlmChatCompletionMessage`, `LlmFeedbackMessage`, `LlmEmbedding`, and `LlmTool`. Your drop filters correspond to event and column pairs in a given row, as seen in the table. 

* In other words, the attribute `content` only appears in the `LlmChatCompletionMessage` event and not in the `LlmEmbedding` event. The attribute `messages` only appears in `LlmFeedbackMessage` but not in `LlmTool`. 
* The exception to this rule is the attribute `input`, which appears in both `LlmEmbedding` and `LlmTool`.
* In the case of `LlmTool`, you need to create queries to account for two attributes `input` and `output`. For example:

  ```sql
      SELECT output FROM LlmTool WHERE output RLIKE ^([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})$
      ```
  ```sql
    SELECT input FROM LlmTool WHERE input RLIKE ^([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})\.([0-9]{1,3})$
    ```

### Regex

Since the agent's default behavior is to capture all parts of event data before sending it to NRDB, you need to direct the agent to match sensitive information with regex. By targeting an attribute with regex, you can still capture the event itself without storing sensitive information in our databases.
