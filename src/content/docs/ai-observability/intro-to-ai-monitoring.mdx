Your AI-powered app introduces new technologies into your tech stack that are hard to monitor, let alone understand. 

[SCREENSHOT HERE] 

With AI Monitoring, you can bridge unfamiliar technologies with familiar solutions, deepening your knowledge about your AI's behavior:

* **Improve the reliability of your AI app.** Use our trace view to find where errors and bugs appear in your vector databases, embedding processes, and completion APIs.
* **Access all of your AI's responses.** With all of your AI's responses available to you, you have total insight into how your AI decides what context to use when behaving with your end user.
* **Track your AI's token usage.** Keep costs down by always knowing how many tokens your AI toolchain uses when generating a response. If tokens go up, it's time to go deeper to optimize your toolchain and reduce cost.

## Get started with AIM [#start-aim]

AI Monitoring uses one of our language agents to instrument your app. Instrumentation establishes a connection between New Relic and your toolchain, giving you the mechanism to observe how your tech performs over time. 

[SCREENSHOT DIAGRAM HERE]

To get started:

* [Create your New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup), if you haven't.
* Follow our [install instructions](/docs/install/aim) to install AIM, then find your data in the platform.
