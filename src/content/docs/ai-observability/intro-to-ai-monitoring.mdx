Your AI-powered app introduces new technologies into your tech stack that are hard to monitor, let alone understand. With AI Monitoring (AIM), you can bridge unfamiliar technologies with familiar solutions, deepening your knowledge about your AI's behavior.

With AIM, you can:

* **Improve the reliability of your AI app.** Use our trace view to find where errors and bugs appear in your vector databases, embedding processes, and completion APIs.
* **Access all of your AI's responses.** With all of your AI's responses available to you, you have total insight into how your AI decides what context to use when behaving with your end user. 
* **Track your AI's token usage.** Keep costs down by always knowing how many tokens your AI toolchain uses when generating a response. If tokens go up, it's time to go deeper to optimize your toolchain and reduce cost.
* **Compare costs across different models.** You can compare the performance, quality, and usage of different models within your toolchain. 

## Debug the AI layer of your app [#ai-layer]

AIM uses our APM agents to expose the AI subset of your data. When a customer makes a request to your AI assistant, your assistant makes a call to collect context from your LLM, its supporting services and databases. This process of gathering context is called a harvest cycle, and it's the heart of your AI data.
