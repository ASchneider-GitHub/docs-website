## Establishing an input performance SLI [#establishing-input-sli]

An overview of the process of establishing an input performance SLI:
1. Create your synthetic check.
2. Create your service level indicator.

Below are more details on these steps.

### 1. Create your synthetic check

The most common input performance service level is often referred to as "connectivity" or "uptime." This is a simple check against a health API endpoint or simply loading a URL. Both of these can be done easily by using our synthetic monitoring service. Please refer to [Add simple browser monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#simple)  and [Add scripted API test](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#complex) to learn how to begin reporting data.

### 2. Create your service level indicator

After completing that first step, you should now have data.

Now you will use the service level management service to create an input indicator and objective.

From the [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts#find), select **Service levels** on the right, and then click **+ Add a service level indicator**.

**Note:** If you don't see the **Add a service level** button, check with your New Relic administrator about your permissions.

Next filter your entity types to `Synthetic monitors`. See screenshot below.

Next steps:

1. Find your synthetic monitor in that list and click it. This will enable the **Continue** button in the left panel. Click **Continue**.
2. You'll see a button for the recommended settings for a **Success** service level (shown below). Click it.
3. Make appropriate changes to the tags, title and description as needed.
4. Click **Save**.
