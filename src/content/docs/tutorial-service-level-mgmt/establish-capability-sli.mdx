## Establishing a capability SLI [#capability-SLI]

This is where you will really accelerate adoption of service levels!

You do not need to have intimate knowledge of an application or service in order to complete this task. You simply need to know where the consumer-facing API (service boundary) is, and follow the steps below.

This is a major step in your observability maturity journey. Having service levels on critical business capabilities, like login or authorize payment, will rapidly close the language barrier between IT and business. Service level scores on capabilities also provide you with a more precise remediation path when their service levels begin to degrade. For example, if the login service level begins to degrade, you'll know to look at identity mangement dependencies and workflows starting at the consumer-facing API.

**Note:** in this task you're building on the skills you learned in the "[Establishing an output SLI](#establishing-output-sli)" section.

Here's an overview of this process:
1. Assess application capabilities.
2. Baseline a capability.
3. Create your capability service level.

These steps will be explained in more detail below.

Identify the service boundary application as described in the [Establishing an output SLI](#establishing-output-sli) section above.

Run the following NRQL query to identify baselines on the most frequently used transactions. Be sure to replace `Order-Processing` with the application name you identified.

```
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*), percentile(duration, 95) WHERE appName='Order-Processing' FACET name SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```

You should see something similar to the screenshot below.

  src={queriesnrqlTransactionListNrql}

You'll see the first transaction states it has something to do with "purchase." You can now create a "purchase" capability service level.

**Note:** Even if you're not sure that this transaction represents the purchase capability, this exercise makes a great example to show the application team and your leadership the value of capability service levels. Remember, your goal here is to start a conversation with the stakeholders by showing the art-of-the-possible.

Add `WHERE name='Controller/Sinatra//purchase'` to the end of your query, replacing `Controller/Sinatra//purchase` with your transaction name. Run the query to make sure it works. You should now see only the one transaction in your result. Copy this query and the `DURATION (95%)` result into a notepad. You'll need both in a moment.

Create a new service level in the platform. Starting a new service level is described in [Establishing an input performance SLI](#establishing-input-sli).

In this case you want to find your application (APM `Entity` type) in the list so we can retain the metadata (tags) through the entity GUID. Instead of "Synthetic monitor" as in section above, select "APM" in the entity filter dropdown.

Select the "Latency" guided workflow so the good and valid queries are auto-populated for you.

Use your notepad to copy just the `name='your/transaction/name/here'`.

Add this condition to both queries in service levels, **preceded with an `AND `**, as underlined in the screenshot below.

  alt="capability query clause"
  src={apmCapabilityFilterClause}
/>


Simply adjust the `duration < 1.78` portion of the second query to match the `DURATION (95%)` result in your original baseline copied to your notepad.

Proceed to name this service level, update the description, and save the service level.

It's recommended to set up a few of these capability service levels and present to the application team and your leadership for feedback.
