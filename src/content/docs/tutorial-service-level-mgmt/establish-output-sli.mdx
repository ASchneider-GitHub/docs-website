## Establishing an output performance SLI [#establishing-output-sli]

Here's an overview of the steps for establishing an output performance SLI:
1. Identify your service
2. Identify your service boundary
3. Establish your baseline
4. Create your service level

We'll now describe these steps in more detail.

### 1. Identify your service

The following is assumed:
* Your primary applications are instrumented with [New Relic APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm).
* Your application names follow a familiar naming convention, as outlined in our [Service characterization guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/sc-implementation-guide/#improvement-process).
* You can find your application in our [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts#find).

In the entity explorer, find your application (entity type of `Services - APM`) and select it. You should see the overview screen below. **Don't click `Service levels` yet.**

### 2. Identifying your service boundary [#identifying-service-boundary]

Be sure to read the definition of [service boundaries](#slm-terminology-service-boundary) in the [terminology section](#terminology) above.

The goal here is to ensure you're measuring the output of your service, first. While dependencies of that application each play a part in response times and success rates, the final and total response time and success is easily measured at the point where the request is received and responded to.

Use [service maps](/docs/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/how-use-service-maps/) and [automaps](/docs/new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps) to help determine the application you're looking at is a dependency of your application or the application that runs the endpoint API.

**Example**

In the screenshot below you are responsible for all applications that support order processing. You selected #2 (Order-Composer) to start, clicked **Service maps**, and discovered that Order-Composer is really a dependency; therefore, you will need to select #1 (Order-Processing) in order to establish a true health service level.

Your team may only be accountable for the dependency, Order-Composer. If that's the case, then your own service level on Order-Composer is perfectly acceptable for your own self-monitoring of performance. Be sure to tag your own non-customer facing service levels as `customer-facing:false` to allow for better filtering in health reports. Also, consider collaborating with the customer-facing endpoint (#1 Order-Processing) in your observability journey in order to establish true output performance, an input connectivity service level, and client service levels.

### 3. Establishing your baseline

Establishing a baseline is a critical step to accelerating adoption and implementation of service levels. It's more challenging to determine what the design specifications are or **should have been** for services. Establishing a baseline allows you to measure the current performance of a service and then, through the service level reports, you will know if you are hitting that baseline or degrading.

You can create a baseline for virtually any dataset; however, there are different formulas and recommendations for different use cases. For example, you should use the average for some datasets, percentiles for others, and max for others.

When starting service levels you should start with [output performance](#key-performance-indicators) of your applications. For this we use response times (latency) and percentage of non-errors (success).

**How much history should be considered?** Not much, in fact. You're establishing a reliability health metric. Seasonality and peak usage is not a handicap for good performance. Also, the more history you include in your measurement, the more likely you are including different codebases from releases. Previous deployments, no matter how small, could skew your results.

The recommended history is one to two weeks of performance data to establish a fair baseline.

#### Example baselines

Here's an example NRQL query that represents the recommended target for a 7-day service level objective for latency:

```
FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(duration, 95) AS 'Latency Baseline SLI' WHERE appName='Order-Processing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```

<img
  alt="Latency Baseline"
  src={apmLatencyBaseline}
/>

For a success (error-free) baseline, try the following query. Be sure to substitute `Order-Processing` for your own application name.

```
FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error is false) AS 'Success Baseline SLI' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO WHERE appName='Order-Processing'
```

### 4. Create your service level

The New Relic platform will automatically calculate recommended <InlinePopover type="apm" /> and browser baselines for you.

**Note:** If you don't see the **Add a service level** button, check with your New Relic administrator about your permissions.

The "[Identifying your service](#1-identifying-your-service)" section above shows you how to find your application APM data. You'll see #2 in the screenshot in that same section, called "Service levels." Find your application APM data and click **Service levels**. You should see the view below.

<img
  alt="Service levels start from APM"
  src={apmSLStartFromApm}
/>

Click **Add baseline service level objectives** and almost instantly you will have both your Latency SLI and Success SLI and their respective objectives created for you.

You can view and change all the settings by clicking the three dot icon in the upper-right corner of each SLO scorecard.

**Note:** It will take approximately 10 minutes for data to populate the SLO scores. This is because we use the [events-to-metrics service](/docs/data-apis/convert-to-metrics/create-metrics-other-data-types/) for data longevity and query performance. It takes a moment for the conversion to take place and begin to populate the data.
