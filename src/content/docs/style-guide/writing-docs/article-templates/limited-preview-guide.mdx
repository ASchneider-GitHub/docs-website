title: Your first limited preview doc

Limited preview docs are different from our public docs site. Unlike public docs, only a small subset of our customers have access to limited preview (LP) content and it's through a direct URL. That means if you don't have the URL, you can't access the contentâ€“either by Google search, our repo, or accidentally. This doc outlines the LP process and what a new writer can expect, as well as the kind of content they might consider for their LP doc(s). This is by no means prescriptive. Rather, we just want to lay the foundation for you to do your thing.

## How does an LP doc differ from GA docs? [#process]

When you're assigned an LP project, it means New Relic is launching a new feature or capability that's still a work in progress. The LP period allows field folks and developers to work out the kinks of their project. How do customers use it differently than expect? Where are the pain points? What features do customers want? Depending on what they find, the product can evolve into its more polished form for general availability (GA). 

This means your LP doc may look different from the set of docs you release at GA. Despite sharing the same product, they serve different functions. The biggest factor distinguishing your LP doc from its GA evolution is audience. 

* An LP doc is supportive material for other New Relic employees to onboard a set of volunteering customers. You're answering broad questions to help these users get started without writing a dedicated get started doc. It's likely the customers who volunteered are already New Relic users. It's also likely they'll be a fair bit of hand holding, too. Because of this, your LP doc is limited in scope and doesn't need all the bells and whistles a traditional get started doc might have. 
* GA docs include your bread and butter content: intro, install, some kind of UI explanation, a tutorial, and maybe troubleshooting content. They're robust and require info architecting. They need to anticipate all kinds of audiences while balancing the least experience without the power users, all without losing one or both groups. 

## Identify your SMEs [#identify]

## Writing your first LP content [#first]

You might've noticed we refer to LP content in the singular, while GA content is pluralized. Because of the limited scope of your LP doc, less is more. The product isn't finished and you still don't yet know how customers will use the product, or where development will go during LP. Writing one doc for LP isn't a hard and fast rule, however. We recommend you try to capture as much as you can in one doc, but if in the process you realize it's inhibiting a good onboarding experience, then we encourage you to make that decision. Here are our recommendations:

* Start with one doc. Since customers need a URL to access this content, spreading info across multiple pages can create a frustrating experience.
* Include a brief intro and a screenshot. Since your audience have volunteered, they may not need a snazzy intro and likely just want to get started. The screenshot gives them a north star to work to. 
* Spend time with your SMEs to work out install content. This is your opportunity to go deep on the set up.
* Overview the UI, focusing on how customers can use it to solve problems. 
* End with a troubleshooting section. The product is in preview, so there may be known issues you can summarize for your customers.
