title: Your first limited preview doc
freshnessValidatedDate: 2023-12-06
---

For limited preview (LP), a small subset of New Relic users have exclusive access to a new feature or capability. While the feature or capability may be unavailable to general audiences for some time yet, teams still need docs to offer onboarding guidance about install processes and how customers can access their data after set-up. 

This doc walks you through different considerations for writing LP docs. We'll give you some recommendations about planning these docs and an example template to help you get started. 

## How does an LP doc differ from GA docs? [#process]

The LP period lets developers and engineers work out the kinks of their project. Do customers use the capability differently than expected? Where are the pain points? What additional features are needed? Depending on what dev teams find, the product can evolve into its more polished form for general availability (GA). 

Because the thing you're writing about is still a work in progress, you should approach your LP doc differently. Like with any doc, you want to start with your audience.

        <tr>
            <th>
                Docs for limited preview (LP)
            </th>

        <tr>
            <td>
            LP audiences are existing New Relic users. They have some context with other products and volunteered to work with devs, engineering, and field to understand how a product should work for GA. Since the period is limited, these users also have a team to help them along the way.
            </td>
            <td>
            GA audiences could be  anyone, new users with zero experience or power users on enterprise teams. You write sets of docs to capture the breadth of potential audiences and use cases. 

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                An LP doc is supportive material for other New Relic employees to onboard a set of volunteering customers. Your doc answers broad questions about getting started and how to use the product as it exists for LP. Because of the unfinished nature of the thing you're writing about, your LP doc is limited in scope. It may not need all the bells and whistles a traditional get started doc might have. 
            </td>
            <td>
                GA docs include your bread and butter content: intro, install, some kind of UI explanation, a tutorial, and maybe troubleshooting content. They need to anticipate different audiences while balancing less experienced with our power users.

## Writing your first LP content [#first]

You might've noticed we refer to LP content in the singular, while GA content is pluralized. Because of the limited scope of your LP doc, less is more. The product isn't finished and you still don't yet know how customers will use the product, or where development will go during LP. Writing one doc for LP isn't a hard and fast rule, however. We recommend you try to capture as much as you can in one doc, but if in the process you realize it's inhibiting a good onboarding experience, then we encourage you to make that decision. Here are our recommendations:

* Start with one doc. Since customers need a URL to access this content, spreading info across multiple pages can create a frustrating experience.
* Include a brief intro and a screenshot. Since your audience have volunteered, they may not need a snazzy intro and likely just want to get started. The screenshot gives them a north star to work to. 
* Spend time with your SMEs to work out install content. This is your opportunity to go deep on the set up.
* Overview the UI, focusing on how customers can use it to solve problems. 
* End with a troubleshooting section. The product is in preview, so there may be known issues you can summarize for your customers.
