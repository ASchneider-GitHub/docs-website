Limited preview docs are different from our public docs site. Unlike public docs, only a small subset of our customers have access to limited preview (LP) content and it's through a direct URL. That means if you don't have the URL, you can't access the contentâ€“either by Google search, our repo, or accidentally. This doc outlines the LP process and what a new writer can expect, as well as the kind of content they might consider for their LP doc(s). This is by no means prescriptive. Rather, we just want to lay the foundation for you to do your thing.

## What is an LP period? [#process]

When you're assigned an LP project, it means New Relic is launching a new feature or capability that's still a work in progress. The LP period allows field folks and developers to work out the kinks of their project. Some questions they're still working out comes down to how customers use a given project. How do customers use it differently than expect? Where are the pain points? What are the shared feature requests across product? Depending on the answers, the product can evolve into its more polished iteration at general availability (GA). 

This means your LP docs may look different from the set of docs you release at GA. Despite sharing the same product, they serve different functions.
