Small and large UX animations seem like table stakes on docs sites these days. Here are some interesting examples.

<img

    alt="An animation of subtle mouseover animations in the Dropwizard left nav"

<figcaption>
    from https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/index.html. Even quite aesthetically displeasing docs sites have added bits of animation to their docs sites.

<img

    alt="An animation of Stripe's menu animations"
    src={styleguideStripeMenuAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://stripe.com/docs#products. There’s a lot of animation here, but it all serves a nice purpose. The popovers at the top give you a little more context about each of those links. The auto-rotating gallery of codeblocks presents a subtle call to action (it stops when you click one). The borderless links below highlight nicely when you hover over them so that you know exactly what you’ll be clicking on. It’s a near thing, but they find a nice balance between usefulness and busy-ness with these animations.
