Small and large UX animations seem like table stakes on docs sites these days. Here are some interesting examples.

<img
    title="Mouseover button animation"
    alt="An animation of the mouseover animation for a very large Documentation button"
    src={styleguideEleventyAnimation}

<figcaption>
    from https://www.11ty.dev/. I love the passion for documentation that this betrays.

<img
    title="Left nav animations"
    alt="An animation of subtle mouseover animations in the Dropwizard left nav"
    src={styleguideDropwizardAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/index.html. Even quite aesthetically displeasing docs sites have added bits of animation to their docs sites.

<img
    title="Stripe's use of color and animation"
    alt="An animation of Stripe's menu animations"
    src={styleguideStripeMenuAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://stripe.com/docs#products. There’s a lot of animation here, but it all serves a nice purpose. The popovers at the top give you a little more context about each of those links. The auto-rotating gallery of codeblocks presents a subtle call to action (it stops when you click one). The borderless links below highlight nicely when you hover over them so that you know exactly what you’ll be clicking on. It’s a near thing, but they find a nice balance between usefulness and busy-ness with these animations.

<img
    title="Docs homepage mouseover animations"
    alt="An animation showing the mouseover color on the Linode docs homepage"
    src={styleguideLinodeMouseoverAnimation}

<figcaption>
    from https://www.linode.com/docs/. I like the subtle use of hover animation + color here.

<img
    title="Sometimes animation goes too far"
    alt="An animation showing the dizzying animation in Wolfram Alpha docs"
    src={styleguideWolframAlphaAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Image.html. Sometimes animation can feel like a little too much. I find the Wolfram docs dizzying in how interactive they feel.

<img
    title="Animations can be visually appealing"
    alt="An animation of the lovely mathematical visualizations on the signal processing site"
    src={styleguideSignalProcessingAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/. I love the animation of the fourier transform. I love the DFW pull quote. I really like the color in the header up top. I do NOT like how small the text is.

<img
    title="Animations can preview process and time commitment"
    alt="An animation showing CLI progress bars"
    src={styleguideFastapiAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/. An animation can provide a preview a process and the time commitment involved. What this animation communicates to me: this will not take long to install.
