The homepage is the front porch of a docs site. What it looks like, how it feels, how effective it is at orienting the reader to what they want to find all affect the first impression a reader has about your docs and what the docs represent.

    title="A homepage that's clear, clean, and simple"
    alt="A screenshot of the Full Calendar icon homepage, with its clean/crisp layout."
    src={styleguideFullCalendarIconHomepage}

<figcaption>
    from https://fullcalendar.io/docs#main. This reminds me of Ikea’s construction manuals a little bit. I like how few words there are here, with these distinct, but easily parsable icons. Contrast this with the pretty overwhelming text version that follows.

<img
    title="A lot of text on a homepage can feel overwhelming"
    alt="A screenshot of Full Calendar's docs site's index version of its homepage"
    src={styleguideFullCalendarHomepageIndex}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://fullcalendar.io/docs#toc. Yikes! By contrast, the index or text version of the homepage feels a bit overwhelming. But I think this could be pretty handy for someone who already knows the content well.

<img
    title="Pleasing art can make a docs homepage more welcoming"
    alt="A screenshot of GitHub's homepage, with lovely header image"
    src={styleguideGithubDocsHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.github.com/en. I really love this banner image at the top and I find it pretty inviting. (I’m less thrilled by those columns of links below.) (I almost put this in the striking use of color category.)

<img
    title="Docs sites are humanized by showing the humans who work on it"
    alt="A screenshot of the Clojure docs homepage which includes a gallery of contributors"
    src={styleguideClojureHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://clojuredocs.org/. A lot of real humans worked on this open source docs site! And, look, they did it recently! Personally, I find this kind of humanization pretty appealing.

<img
    title="Something as simple as nice logo can make a homepage more appealing"
    alt="A screenshot of the CoffeeScript docs homepage with coffee cup logo"
    src={styleguideCoffescriptHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://coffeescript.org/#introduction. I love the icon. I love how friendly this writing is. But I also think it’s a little too verbose. Still! Imagine what it would be like if New Relic were so easy to install.

<img
    title="Boring can be good, sometimes, especially if it all fits on a single page"
    alt="A screenshot of the Symfony docs homepage with simple icons and columns of links"
    src={styleguideSymfonyHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html. The feeling I get from this homepage is that I can get a sense of what it’s all about in a single glance. I like the use of simple icons here, even though they are a bit boring. (The individual docs here are a lot busier visually, not really living up to the promise of this homepage.)
