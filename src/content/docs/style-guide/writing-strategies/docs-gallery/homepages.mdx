The homepage is the front porch of a docs site. What it looks like, how it feels, how effective it is at orienting the reader to what they want to find all affect the first impression a reader has about your docs and what the docs represent.

<img
    title="A homepage that's clear, clean, and simple"
    alt="A screenshot of the Full Calendar icon homepage, with its clean/crisp layout."
    src={styleguideFullCalendarIconHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://fullcalendar.io/docs#main. This reminds me of Ikea’s construction manuals a little bit. I like how few words there are here, with these distinct, but easily parsable icons. Contrast this with the pretty overwhelming text version that follows.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A lot of text on a homepage can feel overwhelming"
    alt="A screenshot of Full Calendar's docs site's index version of its homepage"
    src={styleguideFullCalendarHomepageIndex}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://fullcalendar.io/docs#toc. Yikes! By contrast, the index or text version of the homepage feels a bit overwhelming. But I think this could be pretty handy for someone who already knows the content well.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Pleasing art can make a docs homepage more welcoming"
    alt="A screenshot of GitHub's homepage, with lovely header image"
    src={styleguideGithubDocsHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.github.com/en. I really love this banner image at the top and I find it pretty inviting. (I’m less thrilled by those columns of links below.) (I almost put this in the striking use of color category.)
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Docs sites are humanized by showing the humans who work on it"
    alt="A screenshot of the Clojure docs homepage which includes a gallery of contributors"
    src={styleguideClojureHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://clojuredocs.org/. A lot of real humans worked on this open source docs site! And, look, they did it recently! Personally, I find this kind of humanization pretty appealing. 
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Something as simple as nice logo can make a homepage more appealing"
    alt="A screenshot of the CoffeeScript docs homepage with coffee cup logo"
    src={styleguideCoffescriptHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://coffeescript.org/#introduction. I love the icon. I love how friendly this writing is. But I also think it’s a little too verbose. Still! Imagine what it would be like if New Relic were so easy to install.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Boring can be good, sometimes, especially if it all fits on a single page"
    alt="A screenshot of the Symfony docs homepage with simple icons and columns of links"
    src={styleguideSymfonyHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html. The feeling I get from this homepage is that I can get a sense of what it’s all about in a single glance. I like the use of simple icons here, even though they are a bit boring. (The individual docs here are a lot busier visually, not really living up to the promise of this homepage.)
</figcaption>

<img
    title="First steps and returning users: Clear direction can be a boon to readers"
    alt="A screenshot of the Scala docs homepage"
    src={styleguideScalaHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.scala-lang.org/. I like the breakdown between first steps and returning users. Although why they didn’t just go with “new users” and “returning users” is baffling to me. 
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Effective illustrations can quickly reveal what a thing is"
    alt="A screenshot of the GitHub Primer design system homepage with header image diagram"
    src={styleguidePrimerHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://primer.style/design/. Effective use of an illustration. I find this very appealing. Also, there are just four links above the fold (not counting the left nav sidebar that I’ve cropped out)
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A small set of options help readers avoid decision paralysis"
    alt="A animation of the Riak docs homepage with only three options"
    src={styleguideRiakHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.riak.com/. I have no idea what this is, but I know I only have three things to choose from. Comforting! (Unfortunately, I find their actual docs completely baffling to navigate.)
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A friendly tone is welcoming"
    alt="An animation of the Ember.js docs homepage highlighting friendly writing and mouseover animatio"
    src={styleguideEmberjsHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://guides.emberjs.com/release/. I like the subtle use of animation and the warm and friendly tone in that intro. It still doesn’t help me know which of these squares I should click in, though.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="It's a powerful thing when your entire index fits easily on one page"
    alt="An animation of the Go language docs that show the minimalist index"
    src={styleguideGoHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://gobyexample.com/. An effective use of minimalism. I don’t think our docs site could work like this, but maybe there’s some inspiration we can take from this somehow. 
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Poor aesthetics can get in the way of solid information architecture"
    alt="A screenshot of the SQLAlchemy docs homepage"
    src={styleguideSqlalchemyHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/. I find this homepage very aesthetically displeasing. I do like how they’ve broken things out into Getting Started, Tutorials, Migrations Notes, and Reference and How To. I also like the distinction between Python beginners and veterans.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Minimalism can go too far"
    alt="An animation of the Grav homepage showing the aggressive informational minimalism"
    src={styleguideGravHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://learn.getgrav.org/17. I’m really not sure how I feel about this aggressively minimalist homepage. I think here it gets in the way of usability.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A little playfulness can make docs feel more approachable"
    alt="A screenshot of the Atlassian git docs homepage"
    src={styleguideAtlassianGitDocs}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://www.atlassian.com/git. Who knew Atlassian wrote some git docs!? I think the playful header here and the simple nav make this feel pretty approachable.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="Nuts and bolts and a cute mole icon"
    alt="A screenshot of the LTTng docs homepage"
    src={styleguideLttngHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://lttng.org/docs/v2.13/#doc-nuts-and-bolts. What I like: “Nuts and bolts”, the mole in the top left, the deliberate public Git repository callout. 
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A clear call to action and I can tell at a glance if my language is supported"
    alt="An animation of the tabs on the DocRaptor docs homepage"
    src={styleguideDocraptorHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docraptor.com/documentation. I like how the homepage presents a clear call to action, with tabs for every conceivable language. Why “Other” is first, I have no idea!
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A simple and bright docs homepage"
    alt="A screenshot of the Sequelize docs homepage"
    src={styleguideSequelizeHomepage}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://sequelize.org/. I like how simple and bright this homepage is. Also, with a clear call to action.
</figcaption>

<img
    title="A simple and bright header can be appealing"
    alt="A screenshot of the JavaScript Framework docs homepage header"
    src={styleguideJavascriptHomepageHeader}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://vuejs.org/. I like how simple this is. Although I’m not totally sure why they need Get Started AND Install: a muddy call to action.
