In general, we address our reader directly when we want them to do something (like in a procedure), but there can be times when it's useful to let the reader in on how we're thinking about things and why we're doing things one way and not another. I call this "breaking the fourth wall". Here are some examples of where I thought it was used effectively.

    from https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/preface/#preface-audience. I like the way that this addresses the different types of readers and how they might find the most use in these docs.

    from https://guides.rubyonrails.org/. It might feel unsettling to reveal this kind of transparency (hey, we haven’t finished this yet) and it calls to mind a little bit the working man icon for sites in progress in the 90s, but I sort of respect this open acknowledgement that there’s work still to do.
