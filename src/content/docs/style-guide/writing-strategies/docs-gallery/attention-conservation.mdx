The science fiction writer Bruce Sterling coined the term "attention conservation notice" to describe intro text that lets someone know what follows so they can decide whether it's what they want before investing a lot of time to find out themselves.

    from https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html. The science fiction writer Bruce Sterling called this kind of note an “attention conservation notice”. I like how this explains to me what I’ll learn from reading this doc. If this isn’t what I’m looking for, I can go somewhere else.
