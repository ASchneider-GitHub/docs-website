<figcaption>
    from https://www.linode.com/docs/products/platform/billing/. Every section of the Linode docs has these pretty consistent header icons that let you navigate through the docs in that category. I think this kind of consistency is pretty powerful.

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html. I find the TOC in the right nav here to be a really effective way of communicating the content of this doc page. I put it down to a really thoughtful use of headers.

<figcaption>
    from https://www.gevent.org/api/gevent.html. I found these docs extremely unpleasant to read, but the page menu button! I like how it stays out of the way until I want it and it has the level of detail/granularity that I would hope for in this type of menu.

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.posit.co/. I think the consistency of where the installation, upgrade, admin guide, etc, is very helpful in terms of orienting to where specific info is. I do think thereâ€™s way too much white space here.
