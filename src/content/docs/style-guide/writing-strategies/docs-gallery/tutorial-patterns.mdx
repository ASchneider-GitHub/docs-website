There are a lot of examples of interesting tutorial patterns. There's something about the tutorial genre that frees up technical writers to innovate on content more.

    from https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/recap/. I like this tutorial recap that highlights everything that someone did. I think itâ€™s also an effective way to communicate what I will do if I get through the whole thing. Reinforces a sense of accomplishment.

<figcaption>
    from https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/. I really like how this tutorial provides an example of the finished app right at the start. If a tutorial has someone create something, it can be useful to show finished examples.
