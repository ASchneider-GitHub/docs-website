Site search is a key tool for helping people navigate and find content.

<figcaption>
    from https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs. I like this nav filter instead of search. It may not be as friendly as a full-site search, but considering how poorly our site search works, maybe this is a solid alternative? Look how snappy that is! Sometimes full-text search is overrated.

    from https://sequelize.org/. I like how this search has results for pages and within pages and the all results page takes you to a full screen of results. It also feels really snappy.
