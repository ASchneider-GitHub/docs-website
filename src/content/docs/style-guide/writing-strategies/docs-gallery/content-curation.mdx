Actively curating content is a way to express to readers what's important and can be useful in saving people time and directing people to content we think is important. By expressing an opinion about content, we can guide people's attention.

<figcaption>
    from https://developer.android.com/guide. I think calling out specifically useful docs that, I’m assuming, the Android Developers docs team has chosen as being essential is far more effective than, for example, the popular docs or what’s new sections on our docs site.

<figcaption>
    from https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/terminology. I like this deliberate definition of terms unique to Packer. They’ve limited themselves to less than 10. Calling attention to important terms is another form of curation.
