Oddly, there aren't many aspirational or inspirational quotations about technical writing and documentation. I certainly didn't find much on docs sites themselves! My sense of things is that tech writers and documentarians are bit too busy just getting the work done. Here are some quotes that jumped out at me as I browsed around.

<Callout variant="quotation" title="Quote">
We need documentation to meet standards of accuracy, completeness, consistency, usefulness, precision and so on. We can call these aspects of its functional quality. Documentation that fails to meet any one of them is failing to perform one of its key functions.

[...] There are other characteristics, that we can call deep quality.
[...]

Think of characteristics such as:
* feeling good to use
* having flow
* fitting to human needs
* being beautiful
* anticipating the user

Unlike the characteristics of functional quality, they cannot be checked or measured, but they can still be clearly identified. When we encounter them, we usually (not always, because we need to be capable of it) recognise them.
</Callout>

_From https://diataxis.fr/quality/. I really like this differentiation between objective and subjective qualities of great docs. Personally, I think we do pretty good with our functional quality, but we do a lot less thinking about the (in my view, far more difficult) deep quality._

<Callout variant="quotation" title="Quote">
In my eyes, there are eight rules that we can follow to produce good documentation:

# Write documentation that is inviting and clear
# Write documentation that is comprehensive, detailing all aspects of the project
# Write documentation that is skimmable
# Write documentation that offers examples of how to use the software
# Write documentation that has repetition, when useful
# Write documentation that is up-to-date
# Write documentation that is easy to contribute to
# Write documentation that is easy to find
</Callout>

_From https://www.oreilly.com/content/the-eight-rules-of-good-documentation/. This is a pretty good list._

<Callout variant="quotation" title="Quote">
Good documentation is both technically complex and simple to read and understand: it both has good logic at all levels of organization and works well for readers who won’t read more than a few paragraphs. While documentation presents complex ideas and documentation resources themselves are reasonably complex works, they must:

* thoroughly describe how a tool or product operates (i.e. what all of the knobs do,)
* how to use the product (i.e. tutorials, installation and configuration guides,) and
* describe possible use and configuration (i.e. use cases, practical guides, case studies.)

Often these goals and requirements conflict with each other, and present substantial challenges to maintaining quality well organized resources.
</Callout>

_From http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/administration/documentation/. I like how this quote calls out the fragmentary nature of how most people interact with docs._

<Callout variant="quotation" title="Quote">
Documentation is valuable as reference and standardization material and because it creates value for organizations and products:

* Good documentation tends to reduce the volume of support requests and erroneous bug/issue reporting. Additionally, good comprehensive documentation makes responding to the remaining support requests easier.
* Good documentation gets knowledge out of people’s heads and into a shared format. This increases reliability, because it reduces a dependence on people’s memories and notes, which may not always be accessible, or may be inconsistent.
* In absence of a specification, documentation can help define and regulate the user experience as development proceeds.
* Without documentation users may be unaware of features and behaviors, which reduces their value. If users never learn about or take advantage of new features and functionality, then development resources are essentially wasted.
</Callout>
