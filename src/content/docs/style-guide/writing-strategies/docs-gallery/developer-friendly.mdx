title: Developer-friendly docs
metaDescription: "Developer-friendly" is pretty amorphous, but I think there are things we can do to make our docs align to that.

I haven't crystallized my thinking on what makes a docs site developer-friendly, but I think a big part of it is easy access to code examples and specific use cases.

<img
    title="Practical tools fore code creation are definitely developer-friendly"
    alt="An animation showing stripe's widget that creates a custom code block example"
    src={styleguideStripeTutorialAnimation}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://stripe.com/docs/payments/quickstart. A very slick tutorial that walks you through the code, explaining it while also giving you (I think?) code you can use write away once you’ve gone through it all. Very slick. I could easily imagine something like this for our agent config files.

<img
    title="Clear, concise, readable API docs are developer friendly"
    alt="A screenshot of Stripe's API docs"
    src={styleguideStripeApiDoc}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance/balance_object?lang=curl. Another place that Stripe really excels is in its clear, concise API docs.

<img
    title="Editable code is developer friendly"
    alt="An animation of CoffeeScript's interactive code"
    src={styleguideCoffeescriptInteractiveCode}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://coffeescript.org/#introduction. On the CoffeeScript docs homepage, there’s this interactive codeblock that lets you edit the coffeescript to see what the javascript would look like. Imagine if we had something like this for an interactive NRQL query that generates a new chart.

<figcaption>
    from https://primer.style/design/foundations/typography. These GitHub design docs are sprinkled with widgets (and images) that clarify what’s going on. Another good example is here: https://primer.style/design/foundations/css-utilities/animations
