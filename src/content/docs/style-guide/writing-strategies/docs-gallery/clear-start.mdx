It's a gift of kindness to your readers to provide a clear starting place. Here are some examples I thought were pretty effective.

<img
    title="If you only have one place to start, it's pretty clear where to go"
    alt="A screenshot of Ruby on Rails Start Here"
    src={styleguideRubyonRailsStart}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://guides.rubyonrails.org/. When there's only one place to start, it’s real clear where I should start!

<img
    title="It's easy to get the clear starting place wrong"
    alt="A screenshot of Django docs where the first steps are muddied with too many links"
    src={styleguideDjangoFirstSteps}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/. Somewhat ironically, this “First steps” section at the top of the Django docs homepage is somewhat vague on where I should go first. I guess I should just work my way through these bullets and each of their links? I’ve seen this a lot, where a get started or first steps section has, perhaps, too many options.

<img
    title="Sometimes it's useful to give the expert a clear thing to do"
    alt="A screenshot of Bootstrap's clear call to action with CLI command"
    src={styleguideBootstrapStart}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://getbootstrap.com/. This presents a very clear call to action. Either run that command or read the docs (to learn more) presumably. I like the simplicity here. The “New” tag at the top is probably an effective signal that something has changed if I come here a lot.

<img
    title="Information architecture can be an effective way to provide a clear starting place"
    alt="A screenshot of the Erlang table of contents"
    src={styleguideErlangToc}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content. I like how this TOC tells a pretty clear story of what to do.

<img
    title="A paragon of brevity"
    alt="An animation showing all of the Hogan.js docs"
    src={styleguideHoganjsBrevity}
/>

<figcaption>
    from https://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/. I don’t think the header is particularly welcoming, but this homepage/docs site is a paragon of brevity, which creates its own kind of clarity.

    alt="A screenshot of the Mailjet homepage, with only two options"

<figcaption>
    from https://dev.mailjet.com/. A clear choice: email or SMS.
