<figcaption>
    from https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-3.html#section1. Probably too much whimsy for us, but I think it can be nice in very small doses.

<figcaption>
    from https://learnyousomeerlang.com/starting-out#the-shell. I love this picture. It made me laugh. I think it’s too much for New Relic docs, but I think it’s worth considering: how might we amuse or delight our readers?

<figcaption>
    from https://primer.style/design/guides/introduction/. Feels like a more reasonable kind of whimsy.

<figcaption>
    from https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/ Another example of perhaps too much whimsy. Still, I like the impulse toward humanizing tips like this.

<figcaption>
    from https://riemann.io/concepts.html. This, to my mind, is the right level of whimsy for New Relic. I love this hand drawn diagram. Even though it looks casual and dashed off, it clearly communicates information.

<figcaption>
    from https://beeware.org/. Pretty fun icon/mascot. They can be pretty polarizing, but if you find a mascot that works, it can really bring people together.
