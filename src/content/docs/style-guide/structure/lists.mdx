Lists are a powerful way to organize information, but they don't always make for a pleasant reading experience. Keep these points in mind when you're writing a list:

* Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item.
* Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters.
* Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information.
* Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point.
* Use tables when your ordered or unordered list would benefit from some extra detail.

## Indentation syntax [#ol-syntax]

Indentation affects the rendering of content within ordered lists. This is extremely important when it comes to ordered lists that contain other components such as images or code-blocks. 

The following table contains examples of how indentation affects the rendering of ordered lists:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Syntax
            </th>
            <th>
                Screenshot
            </th>
            <th>
                Notes
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>         
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
            <td>
                INSERT_CELL_CONTENT
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## In-line lists [#inline-lists]

As an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: [C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications) \| [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/distributed-tracing-go#create-manually) \| [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/api-guides/guide-using-java-agent-api#trace-calls).

You might want to use an in-line list when:

* You're linking to further documentation.
* Customers will likely be selecting a single option.
* The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure).
* You think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space. This may happen in circumstances where a procedure must include several lists. Here's [one example of this](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#enable).
* There are only two or three potential options they'll be choosing from and a bullet point list seems unnecessary. Here's [an example](/install/dotnet#requiremnts).

## Test 1

1. Run the following command to create a NRI-Prometheus config file:

  ```shell
  touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
  ```
2. Paste the following snippet into the new config file. Be sure to update the `cluster_name` and `urls` fields:

  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-prometheus
      config:
        # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true 
        standalone: false

        # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
        emitters: infra-sdk

        # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
        cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

        targets:
          - description: Sonarqube metrics list
            urls: ["http://user_name:password@YOUR_HOST_IP:9000/api/monitoring/metrics"]
  ```

## Test two

```shell
touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
```
2. Paste the following snippet into the new config file. Be sure to update the `cluster_name` and `urls` fields:

```yml

      standalone: false

      # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
      emitters: infra-sdk

      # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

      targets:
        - description: Sonarqube metrics list
          urls: ["http://user_name:password@YOUR_HOST_IP:9000/api/monitoring/metrics"]
