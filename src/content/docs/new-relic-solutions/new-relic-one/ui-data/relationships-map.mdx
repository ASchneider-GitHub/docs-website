The New Relic relationships map feature displays entity-centric maps that help you troubleshoot incidents that cascade through interconnected services. With relationships map, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the relationships around your affected entity.

To use the relationships map, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

## How it works [#how-works]

The relationships map displays relationships between entities in your architecture based on direct calls between services. For example, <InlinePopover type="apm" /> services are represented as nodes on the map and direct calls are represented as arrows. The direction of the arrow shows you the direction of the call being made.

With the relationships map, you get deeper insight into the upstream and downstream relationships surrounding your chosen entity. For example, one feature is the ability to adjust relationship depth so you can see just how far an incident has cascaded. In the following screenshot, you can see a view with the relationship depth set to **One**:

  src={solutionsOmnimapView}
/>

Compare how the relationships map expands outward from the source entity an additional level when the depth is set to **Three**.

<img

  alt="A screenshot of the relationships map from the New Relic UI. This map is set to three relationships out from the source entity."
  src={solutionsAutomapViewrel3}
/>

To understand entities and relationships, as well as how the entity platform synthesizes both from telemetry data, see [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) and [relationships](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial/). To learn more about how the relationships map fits in with our other maps experiences, see [Maps in context](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/maps-in-context)

<Callout variant="important">
  Relationships map auto-expand logic relies on the health status of an entity, which is largely determined by the alert status of that entity. For optimal troubleshooting, ensure that your [alerts are properly configured](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/alerts-applied-intelligence/alerts-best-practices/).

## Find relationships map [#access]

You can access the relationships map whenever you're in an omnimap-powered maps experience, such as [service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps) or [workloads maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads#maps). The simplest way to access it is by using the entity tooltip:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then select either **APM & services**, **Mobile**, or **Browser**.
2. Choose your source entity.
3. Select **Service map** under the **Monitor** category.
3. Hover your cursor over the entity, then click **Map from this entity** in the tooltip. A map pane will open.

Relationships map is available for the following types of entities:

## Timewarp cursor: Go back in time [#timewarp-cursor]

You can use the timewarp feature to explore changes between your entities from the last three hours. Simply move the **Timewarp** cursor to see health status changes. 

<img
  title="Timewarp in relationships map view"
  alt="A screenshot of where to find the timewarp feature in the relationships map UI. You can find timewarp by going to the top pane and moving to the right."
  src={solutionsTimewarp}
/>

## Controls: See only what you need to see [#filter-map]

De-emphasize certain entities on the map with **Health Status**, or hide entities entirely with **Entity types**. Keep in mind that toggling **Health status** will not remove nodes from your map. Instead, it'll remove the entity health outline around the nodes.

  <img
    title="Screenshot showing the top pane, where you can control what you see in the relationships map"
    alt="A screenshot showing two dropdowns that let you control what you see in the relationships map. The screenshot has Not alerting entities and Synthetic monitoring entities de-selected, which alters the map."
    src={solutionsAutomapControls}
  />

## Map symbols [#map-symbols]

Here's a table showing the various health status icons:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Health status
      </th>
