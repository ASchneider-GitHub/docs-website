Service map is a visual representations of your entire architecture from front-end to back-end, providing a comprehensive overview of the interconnected components that make up your system. This map dynamically displays the relationships between your applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services (called [web externals]([#externals])).

## Use service map [#using-service-maps]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Service map works with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) to connect relationships between entities. Service map is still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps.
  </Callout>

To access service map: 
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then select either **APM & services**, **Mobile**, or **Browser**.
2. Select an entity.
3. On the left-hand side, click **Service map**.

### Map from one entity [#map-from-one-entity]

View how entities are related from a specific entity's point of view by hovoring your cursor over an entity and click **Map from this entity**. Service map will update from the perspective of that entity.

  alt="A screenshot of the tooltip that appears when you hover your cursor over an entity."
  src={solutionsMapEntity}
  style={{ width: "70%" }}
/>

### Filter entities [#filter-map]

You can modify the service map based on things like:

* **Health status**: Remove the health status color around affected entities.
* **Entity types**: Hide specific entities from the map.
* **Relationship depth**:
  * **Depth 1**: (Default) Show all entities.
  * **Depth 2**: Show degraded entities only.
  * **Depth 3**: Show degraded entities only.
* **Timewarp**: Explore how entity health changed in the last three hours.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Externals and databases in maps">

In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types:

* Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, **externals** are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported.
* **Databases** are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.
  </Callout>

### View entity performance metrics [#performance-data]

The right-hand pane contains in-depth data about your system performance.

Taken together, maps help you find the exact moment and place an incident appeared in your system.


## Explore service relationships with GraphQL APIs [#api]

You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with in our NerdGraph explorer, a tool to run GraphQL queries and mutations. To get started, see [NerdGraph tutorial: View entity data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/).

## Troubleshoot [#troubleshoot]

If you are unable to view certain entities in service maps, see [Missing or obfuscated data](/docs/troubleshooting-missing-or-obfuscated-data-new-relic-one).

If you have uninstrumented entites, see [Uninstrumented entities in service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/uninstrumented-entities-service-maps).
