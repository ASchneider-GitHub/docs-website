Service maps are visual, dynamic representations of your architecture. Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services.

<Callout variant="tip">
  In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data.
</Callout>

Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture.

## Identify operational issues [#identify-issues]

Service maps are [color-coded](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one#alerts) to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections.

The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database.

With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

## Using service map [#using-service-maps]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Service maps work with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps.
  </Callout>

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then select either **APM & services**, **Mobile**, or **Browser**.
2. Select an entity.
3. On the left-hand side, click **Service map**.

### Map from one entity [#map-from-one-entity]

From the main service map, you can view how entities are related from one entity point of view by hovering your cursor over an entity, then click **Map from this entity**. A map pane will open from the perspective of the selected entity.

<img
    title="Open automap from service maps"
    alt="A screenshot of the tooltip that appears when you hover your cursor over an entity."
    src={solutionsMapEntity}
  />


### Filter by time [#timewarp-cursor]

You can use the timewarp feature to explore changes between your entities from the last three hours. Simply move the **Timewarp** cursor to see health status changes. 

<img
  title="Timewarp in relationships map view"
  alt="A screenshot of where to find the timewarp feature in the relationships map UI. You can find timewarp by going to the top pane and moving to the right."
  src={solutionsTimewarp}
/>

### Filter by entity type and health status [#filter-map]

De-emphasize certain entities on the map with **Health Status**, or hide entities entirely with **Entity types**. Keep in mind that toggling **Health status** will not remove nodes from your map. Instead, it'll remove the entity health outline around the nodes.

<img
    title="Health status filter"
    alt="Screenshot of the health status dropdown"
    src={solutionsHealthStatusFilter}
/>

### Map symbols [#map-symbols]

Here's a table showing the various health status icons:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Health status
      </th>

      <th style="text-align:center">
        Icon
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Critical
      </td>

      <td style="text-align:center">
        <img
          title="Screenshot showing the red critical hexagon"
          alt="Screenshot showing the red critical hexagon"
          src={solutionsCriticalHealthStatus}
        />
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Warning
      </td>

      <td style="text-align:center">

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Not alerting
      </td>

      <td style="text-align:center">

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

          alt="Screenshot showing the gray not-configured hexagon"
          src={accountsConfiguredHealthStatus}

          alt="Screenshot showing the orange anomaly hexagon"
          src={solutionsAnomalyHealthStatus}
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Explore service relationships with GraphQL APIs [#api]

You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with in our NerdGraph explorer, a tool to run GraphQL queries and mutations. To get started, see [NerdGraph tutorial: View entity data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/).

## Externals and databases in maps [#externals]

In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types:

* Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, **externals** are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported.
* **Databases** are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

## Troubleshoot missing nodes [#troubleshoot]

If you are unable to view certain entities in service maps, see [Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data](/docs/troubleshooting-missing-or-obfuscated-data-new-relic-one).
