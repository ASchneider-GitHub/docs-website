New Relic AI is designed to help engineers improve observability. We combined OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) with our unified telemetry data platform to create an AI assistant that deeply understands how both your system and New Relic function. NRAI helps you demystify the complexity of your stack, solve service outages and improve your efficiency simply by asking real, human questions.

## Work with our AI [#work-with-NRAI]

Our AI uses natural language to get to the heart of your specific system. You can interact with NRAI in three ways: chat, the NRQL console, and CodeStream. 

### Ask our AI [#ask-grok]

Our AI has been trained to communicate with engineers using common questions and plain language. Let's say you run an online store, and you start receiving alerts that response times for your `Checkout-service` are lagging. If you don't have time to dig into the issue, you can just ask New Relic AI "What's on fire?" or "What should I handle first today?" New Relic AI can tell you what's broken in your system and help you explore data with charts and tables.

You can work with our AI any time you want by using our interactive chat experience. All you have to do is click the **Ask AI** button available on the top right of most New Relic platform pages. 

### NRQL console [#NRQL-console]

When you chat with our AI it translates your questions into queries so you can visualize your data as a chart, graph, table, or billboard. [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into your applications and infrastructure but when you're in a hurry you might not have time to find the right query to get the data you need. If you're struggling to get a query to work, ask our AI to help you. You can use plain speak to ask questions like, "How is this service performing?" or "How has this service been performing over the past 24 hours?"

To enable NRAI in the NRQL console: 

1. Go to the user menu at the bottom left of the New Relic UI..
2.  Click the **Features** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **New Relic AI** section and click **Enable**.

### Use our AI in CodeStream [#codestream]

Our AI can help summarize and explain errors in CodeStream and recommend potential fixes. To use NRAI in CodeStream, click on any error in the **Observability** section of the CodeStream pane to view the stack trace. Our AI will automatically add its analysis to the discussion thread.

You can also jump into this experience directly from errors inbox by clicking the **Open in IDE** button next to any stack trace. From there you can ask New Relic AI follow-up questions, or bring teammates into the discussion.

## Sample questions [#sample-questions] 

If you want to get to the root cause of latency issues for your app, here are some good questions to ask:

* What are some recent incidents in my system?
* Which infrastructure hosts are showing signs of degradation over the past hour?

Our AI chat experience can also help get you started using New Relic. If you need help organizing your data and setting up alerts, NRAI can act as a guide throughout your onboarding process. Ask our AI questions like:

* How can I use Terraform to create dashboards? 
* How can I improve my alerts setup?
* How can I instrument AWS?

Our AI can also be your partner in observability maturity. If you're responsible for making sure that your app can handle spikes for a big e-commerce event like Black Friday, it's important to understand the state of your system so you can improve it _ahead of time_. Ask our AI:

* How can I improve the performance of my infrastructure?
* Were unique user sessions up or down last week compared to the week before?

## Secure data

We understand that data security and privacy are primary concerns for anyone building and maintaining software. We want you to know that anything you ask our AI is safe. NRAI is built with the same security controls and standards that safeguard New Relic customer data. This means that we will never share your data with other accounts or customers.  We work with vendors that meet our privacy and security standards, and we carefully assess prospective vendors in these critical areas before engaging their services. 

Our AI uses a variety of inputs—like this documentation, a large library of example queries, and your telemetry data—to improve it's responses and always provide the best answer. But even though our AI scans your data as needed to provide context and help you build charts and understand response times, that data is _never stored_ by New Relic.  

## Always learning 

New Relic AI is becoming more accurate and responsive the more it's used. We want to build the AI experience you want. When chatting with our AI, please give its response a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  If you notice something that isn't right or that could be improved, let us know. 

Also, New Relic AI has the capacity to recognize multiple languages and respond in them. If you have use cases for multi-lingual support, please test them with our AI and give us feedback.

* Go to the user menu, click **Help**, then click **Give us feedback**.

New Relic AI responses are AI-generated suggestions. While efforts are made to keep information and responses up to date, suggestions may not always be accurate, complete, or error-free. We encourage you to have a human verify any information provided by our AI using other sources before any action is taken. AI's suggestions are provided without any warranties or guarantees of accuracy.
