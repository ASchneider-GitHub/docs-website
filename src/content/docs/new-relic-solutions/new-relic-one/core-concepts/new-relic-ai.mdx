New Relic AI (NRAI) is designed to help every member of your team improve observability, not just engineers. We have combined OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) with our unified telemetry data platform to create an AI assistant that deeply understands how both your system and New Relic function. New Relic AI helps you demystify the complexity of your stack, solve service outages, and improve your efficiency simply by letting you ask questions in plain language. 

Ask New Relic AI to help you:
* [Analyze error logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#errors)
* [Dive deeper in stack traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/#stack-traces)

## Ways to interact with New Relic AI [#work-with-NRAI]

We help you get to the heart of your system by offering quick and easy ways to ask questions. You can chat with our AI and interact with it in the NRQL console, or work with some of our AI tools directly in the UI.



### Chat with AI [#ask-AI]

Using our interactive chat experience you can work with our AI any time. All you have to do is click the <DoNotTranslate>**Ask AI**</DoNotTranslate> button available on the top right of most New Relic platform pages.

Our AI has been trained to communicate with engineers using common questions and plain language. Let's say you run an online store and start receiving alerts that response times for your `Checkout service` are lagging. If you don't have time to investigate the issue, you can simply ask New Relic AI, "What's on fire?" or "What should I handle first today?" New Relic AI can tell you what's broken in your system and help you explore the data with charts and tables.

#### Sample questions [#sample-questions] 

If you need help with where to begin, here are some prompts.

 <TabsBarItem id="2">Improve response time</TabsBarItem>
 <TabsBarItem id="3">Take observability to the next level</TabsBarItem>
 </TabsBar>

 <TabsPages>

 <TabsPageItem id="1`">
 Our AI chat experience can help get you started using New Relic. If you need help organizing your data and setting up alerts, NRAI can act as a guide throughout your onboarding process. Ask our AI questions like:

* How can I use Terraform to create dashboards? 
* How can I improve my alerts setup?
* How can I instrument AWS?
 </TabsPageItem>

 <TabsPageItem id="2">
 If you want to get to the root cause of latency issues for your app, here are some good questions to ask:

* What are some recent incidents in my system?
* Which infrastructure hosts are showing signs of degradation over the past hour?
 </TabsPageItem>

 <TabsPageItem id="3">
 Our AI can also be your partner in observability maturity. If you're responsible for ensuring that your app can handle spikes for a big e-commerce event like Black Friday, it's essential to understand the state of your system so you can improve it _ahead of time_. Ask our AI:

* How can I improve the performance of my infrastructure?
* Were unique user sessions up or down last week compared to the week before?
 </TabsPageItem>
 </TabsPages>

### Create NRQL queries [#NRQL-console]

[NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) is a powerful tool to gain insights into systems. Still, when you're in a hurry, you might not have time to create the correct query to get the data you need. If you're struggling to get a query to work, ask our AI to help you. You can ask questions like, "How is this service performing?" or "How has this service been performing over the past 24 hours?"

<img

To enable NRAI in the NRQL console: 

1. Go to the user menu at the bottom left of the New Relic UI.
2. Click the <DoNotTranslate>**Features**</DoNotTranslate> tab.
3. Scroll down to the <DoNotTranslate>**New Relic AI**</DoNotTranslate> section and click <DoNotTranslate>**Enable**</DoNotTranslate>.

### Get help analyzing error logs [#errors]

Error logs can be challenging to parse. New Relic AI helps you learn more about errors, query for related information, and ask about next steps. 

To chat with New Relic AI about log errors:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DoNotTranslate> > <DoNotTranslate>**Logs**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Click <DoNotTranslate>**All logs**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Search for `errors`.
2. Click on any resulting log lines and look for the <DoNotTranslate>**Explain this error**</DoNotTranslate> button at the top of the log details panel. Our AI will provide a summary of the error. 

You can take your investigation further by telling our AI about your stack and asking follow-up questions. For example, you can ask: 

```
How often does this error occur? What's the error rate? Is it 1% or 50%?
```
```
What hosts are throwing these errors? Is it across all of my hosts, or is it just affecting one or two of them?
```

### Analyze stack traces in errors inbox [#stack-traces]

Using our AI to analyze stack traces will reduce context switching and help speed up triage and analysis. 

To investigate stack traces in errors inbox with New Relic AI:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DoNotTranslate> > <DoNotTranslate>**Errors inbox**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Select a workload.
3. Look for the <DoNotTranslate>**Explain this error**</DoNotTranslate> button embedded in the Stack trace  panel. Our AI will provide a summary of the error. 

You can dig deeper by asking follow-up questions. For example, you can say: 

```
Hi, I have an Azure environment and am having issues with Redis being periodically unavailable. Can you tell me more about this error? How can I diagnose this issue? 

```
### Fill alerting gaps [#coverage-gaps]

As your team and systems evolve, staying ahead of potential issues is crucial. Alerts are your early warning system, but keeping them up-to-date can be challenging. NRAI can help identify areas where you might be missing critical notifications.

Chat with AI and ask:

```
Show me all of my entities that are not covered by an alert. 
```

```
Show me my OpenTelemetry services that are not covered by an alert.
```

### Recommend alerts [#recommend-alerts]

If you have APM, browser, or mobile applications that you want to monitor but don't know where to start, you can use NRAI. 

To get recommended alert conditions:

 1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** >**Alerts & AI**>**Alert Coverage Gaps**.
 2. Click **Add alerts** in the top right-hand corner.
 3. Select one or more recommended alerts, then click **Next**.
 4. Select an existing policy for your alerts, or create a new one and click **Activate conditions**.

You can further investigate this by chatting with our AI. You can ask:

```
Recommend alerts for this application.
```

Or, let's say you're a product manager and you're not interested in data from staging environments; you only want to be alerted on applications in production, you can ask: 

```
Can you recommend alerts for all my APM applications with `production` in their name?
```

Or, if you run an ecommerce site and you know that you have a lot of customers in a particular region and want to make sure your hosts don't get overloaded, you can ask NRAI:

```
Recommend alerts for all my hosts that contain `YOUR_REGION_HERE`?
```

### Create synthetic monitors [#synthetic]

Synthetic monitoring helps you proactively catch and resolve issues before they affect your customers. You can now create a synthetic monitor by chatting with our AI. This capability allows you to create a ping check monitor from the Portland, OR public location to check the availability of a URL with your desired interval. 

For example:

```
Create a synthetic monitor to check the URL 'newrelic.com' every 10 minutes and name it: 'my awesome monitor'.
```

To create a ping check monitor with NRAI:

 1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** **All Entities**.
 2. Click **Ask AI** in the top right-hand corner.
 3. Tell AI to create a ping check monitor based on your parameters.
 4. Click **Create monitor**.
 5. If you want to see your settings or make any changes, select **Go to monitor**.
 6. Select ** Detailed configuration ** if you want more advanced settings or access to other types of synthetic monitors.

### Check the status of support tickets [#support]

Ask NRAI for a summary of your support tickets to reduce the time to resolution. Revisit solutions and past issues to streamline management. You can also check to see if tickets remain open or can be closed as resolved. 

Chat with AI and ask:

```
Summarize my support ticket(s).
```
```
What is the status of my support ticket(s)?
```

### Demystify your dashboards [#dashboards]

Dashboards are an incredibly useful tool, but if you're new to a specific entity or you're a product manager or executive, you might not understand all the nuances. New Relic AI can be your personal data analyst, automatically summarizing key information and uncovering hidden insights directly within the New Relic UI. 

    1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DoNotTranslate> > <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>
    2. Click **Ask AI** in the top right-hand corner.

Even basic questions can provide detailed summaries that can help clarify complicated data. Try asking: 

```
What is on this dashboard?
```

```
Summarize this dashboard for me. 
```

## Secure data [#secure-data]

Data security and privacy are primary concerns for anyone building and maintaining software. We want you to know that anything you ask our AI is safe. NRAI is built with the same security controls and standards that safeguard New Relic customer data. We will never share your data with other accounts or customers. We work with vendors that meet our privacy and security standards and carefully assess prospective vendors in these critical areas before engaging their services. 

Our AI uses a variety of inputs to improve its responses and always provides the best answer. For example, it uses inputs like our product documentation, an extensive library of example queries, and your telemetry data. But even though our AI scans your data as needed to provide context and help you build charts and understand response times, that data is _never stored_ by New Relic.

## Always learning [#always-learning]

New Relic AI is becoming more accurate and responsive the more it's used. We want to build the AI experience you want. When chatting with our AI, please give its response a thumbs up or a thumbs down. If you notice something that needs to be corrected or that could be improved, let us know. Go to the user menu, click <DoNotTranslate>**Help**</DoNotTranslate>, then click <DoNotTranslate>**Give us feedback**</DoNotTranslate>.

Also, New Relic AI can recognize multiple languages and respond in them. If you have use cases for multi-lingual support, please test them with our AI and give us feedback.

<Callout variant="tip">
New Relic AI responses are AI-generated suggestions. While efforts are made to keep information and responses up to date, suggestions may not always be accurate, complete, or error-free. We would like to encourage you to have a human verify any information provided by our AI using other sources before any action is taken. AI's suggestions are provided without any warranties or guarantees of accuracy.
