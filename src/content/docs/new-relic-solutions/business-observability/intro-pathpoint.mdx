New Relic Pathpoint is an enterprise platform tracker that offers a unique approach to business process observability. It models system health in relation to actual business and user-impacting concepts specific to your digital business.

By monitoring and analyzing the health and performance of all components of the customer journey, including all internal processes and external dependencies, Pathpoint allows organizations to easily identify and resolve issues that impact the customer journey, optimize internal processes, and improve the overall customer experience.

## Overview of Pathpoint resources [#overview-docs]

The sections below cover important concepts and procedures about Pathpoint.

## Pathpoint elements [#elements]

Pathpoint can be a key part of optimizing your business observability. It maps an organization's customer journey, from the initial interaction with the organization through to the completion of the transaction. 

Each Pathpoint is divided into:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-stages" title="Stages"> 

These are the highest level business stages. At the actual system level these will be a rollup of many services and methods and show the complete health, congestion, count and infrastructure state of a Pathpoint.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint stages"
        alt="Pathpoint stages"
        src={stages}
    />

The different stages of a Pathpoint enables you to gain a high-level overview of business processes and identify the different services and methods presented at the system level for each commercial stage.

### Adding stages [#adding-stages]
    
Adding stages is as fast as typing in the stage names.  

    <img
        title="Add stages"
        alt="Add stages"
        src={addSteps}
    />

### Get real-time and historical information for each stage [#real-time-info-for-stage]

You can view real-time information related to a particular stage including any errors associated with it. You can see if any of the associated signals for a particular stage are critical, in which case the stage will turn yellow. If everything is working normally, the stage will stay green. If all signals have anomalies that need to be resolved, the stage will turn red.

In addition to the current state of these indicators, Pathpoint allows for the vizualization of previous states (recently and not so recently) using "playback".

    <img

        alt="Pathpoint plaback"
        src={playback}
    />


</Collapser>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-steps" title="Steps"> 

Steps are "sub-stages" of a parent stage and represent the various events occurring throughout the stage.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint steps"
        alt="Pathpoint steps"
        src={steps}
    />


Steps break down stages but also offer a level of abstraction. Often steps can be represented in some sequential order, known as levels. This allows New Relic to intuitively understand if there is some sequential dependencies between steps.

### Adding steps [#adding-steps]

    <img

        src={addSteps}
    />

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-signals" title="Signals">

Signals are the most granular elements in the Pathpoint model. They are often a specific application monitored by our <InlinePopover type="apm" /> or <InlinePopover type="browser" />, but you can use any New Relic entity or a new relic alert as a signal.  This provides almost limitless flexibility.

Each signal encapsulates a while of information such as the current status of that signal, information about related entities, and the historical knowledge of previous states.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint signals"
        alt="Pathpoint signals"
        src={signals}
    />

### Adding signals [#adding-signals]

Adding signals to Pathpoint is as simple as navigating a list of entities and alerts in your account.  It is easy to filter them by name and add only the ones you want.  No custom queries are required.

    <img
        title="Add signals"
        alt="Add signals"
        src={addSignals}
    />

### Signal status [#touchpoint-status]

Like the entities or alerts they are related to signals have three different health statuses, which are color-coded for easy identification:

* Green: The signal is healthy, and everything is working as expected.
* Gray: The signal requires attention.  Perhaps there is a configuration issue (such as a missing alert) or the telemetry is not available.
* Red: The signal is in a fail state, and there are critical issues that require immediate attention.

Every step in Pathpoint is connected to one or more signals. As such, the health status of every step is dependent on the status of its respective signals. Therefore, signals are considered the pulse of each Pathpoint. By monitoring the status of signals, you can gain insights into the health of the entire system and identify any anomalies that need attention.

<Callout variant="tip">
    By default, you'll only see all signals. However you can choose to see "unhealthy only" or "critical only" to simplify your view.
</Callout>

### View signal details [#view-signal-details]

Signals that are directly tied to a New Relic entity will inherit the status of that entity.  Clicking on a signal icon will pop up a window that shows you all of the relevant information about your signal such as:

1. Any open incidents
2. The status of any golden signals
3. A link to that entities details page to drill down further

        src={signalDetails}
    />

<Collapser id="business-flow-kpis" title="Business flow KPIs"> 

In addition to the structured signals that are always associated with a New Relic entity or alert, you can add a flexible KPI using a regular NRQL query.  These allow you to keep an eye on overall business impacts that are related to your flow while trying to understand the health of your lower level entities.  Some customers want to have counts for important critical events like user logins, user registrations, successful checkouts, carts abandoned as well as important dollar amounts like total checkout value, total returned product value.   You can usually find some of these in your existing telemetry and they donâ€™t have to be associated with an entity.  They can be logs, custom metrics, etc.

</Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

By tracking each of these components, Pathpoint provides a comprehensive view of how customers interact with an organization at every stage of their journey. This makes it possible to identify and diagnose issues quickly, optimize the customer experience, and make data-driven decisions to drive better business outcomes.
