Welcome to our cutting-edge observability platform. Here, knowledge meets innovation in tech's ever-changing landscape. Today, organizations navigate complex distributed systems and produce massive amounts of telemetry data. They can have many microservices, sometimes thousands. Countless tools spread the microservices. They are part of many deployments per day and high-tech automation. We are here to help you, our platform will turn this raw data into true observability.

Our all-in-one observability platform brings all that telemetry data to one place. With our observability platform, you gain more than just insightsâ€”you embark on a journey of efficiency and optimization. Detecting issues early and making informed decisions become your allies. It enables you to set alerts and detect anomalies. Receive notifications through various integrations like PagerDuty and ServiceNow. You can also diagnose problems and enhance performance. The dashboard page allows you to collect and visualize specific data easily. 

Our easy interface and strong analytics show the depths of your tech stack. New Relic empower you to discover improvement areas, enhance your applications, and speed up innovation. Join us on this transformative journey and unlock the true potential of observability.

You might be a seasoned DevOps engineer, developer, or aspiring tech enthusiast. We designed our platform to meet you where you are and help you achieve your goals. Get started today and unlock the power of observability like never before. Through this page, you'll start using our platform following a few steps. Then, you'll find a brief description of the main capabilities. Finally, you'll learn that you can have free access, forever!

If you want to learn more, you can explore our [tutorials and walkthroughs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/tutorial-landing-page/) docs.


# Learn how it works

The first step in observability requires collecting lots of performance data, known as telemetry data. Our observability platform gathers data from our services using agents. A process called instrumentation integrates agents into a service. An agent is a file or a few lines of code that collects data on your service and sends it to our platform for analysis.

The agent keeps track of your service's performance by monitoring metrics such as response times and error rates. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into the functioning of your service and identify areas for improvement. An agent is first installed in your environment with a default configuration. The process of installation, setup, and instrumentation can vary. It depends on the service you want to collect data from.

These are the agents at New Relic:

  * **APM agent**: For server-side applications

  * **Browswer agent**: For browser applications

  * **Infrastructure agents**: For hosts and on-host integrations

  * **Mobile agent**: For mobile applications

Besides these agents, we also support open-source integrations. They report data from open standards for instrumentation. These standards include OpenTelemetry and tools like DropWizard, Prometheus, and more.


# Our all-in-one observability [#all-in-one-observability]

New Relic provides visibility at every stage of the software lifecycle through a library of capabilities. You can notice that several of the capabilities in the platform share a name with the agent they use to collect data. Meanwhile, other capabilities use the collected data to perform a specific task.

Our many capabilities will help you monitor, troubleshoot, and improve your digital performance. Here's an explanation of New Relic's key capabilities.

## APM & services [#apm]

New Relic instruments your application at the code level by using one of our many language agents. These agents collect metrics from your application. They send the metrics to our application performance monitoring (APM). This capability lets you monitor it using pre-built dashboards. You can also troubleshoot your applications' performance in real time.

The <InlinePopover type="apm" /> capability provides deep visibility into your app's code. It shows database queries and external service calls. You'll see the individual transactions and the timings of the methods and functions in those transactions. We collect application logs and we enrich transactions with trace IDs. This way, you can follow a transaction from its point of origin, all the way through to completion. You'll see a detailed view of your app's performance. It will help you find and fix bottlenecks.

## Infrastructure [#infrastructure]

This capability lets you monitor the health and performance of your service. It covers containers and cloud infrastructure. It includes tracking CPU, memory, network traffic, and disk use. It also includes over 400 on-host integrations for monitoring third-party apps. You can add Kubernetes and Pixie to see detailed information about the state of your cluster, nodes, and pods. Pixie gives you deeper visibility into your apps in the cluster by querying the kernel directly using EBPF. Insights into our apps without the need to fully instrument them with APM. We can collect your logs from their current locations and display them in context alongside the related entities.

## Network [#network]

With network performance monitoring, you can analyze how well your routers, switches, and other networking devices perform. It will also build a visual network topology. This will let you find performance problems in locations. These problems might affect users in different regions.

## Mobile [#mobile]

Mobile monitoring sends telemetry directly from the end user's mobile app to New Relic. This allows us to analyze the app's performance on the user's device. We can know when the app is crashing or running smoothly. We'll be able to capture connectivity states and device information for the different versions of the app.

## Browser [#browser]

Browser monitoring collects data from the navigation timings in all end users' browsers. It sends that data directly to New Relic while blending with the service that served the requests. When you load that page URL, you can easily see which back-end transaction fulfilled that request.

## Synthetic monitoring [#synthetic]

Synthetic monitoring lets you proactively check that your services are working. It alerts you if there's a problem before your users find out. You can make scripted tests. They simulate complex user journeys and interactions with apps. The tests are from different places and devices.

## Machine-learning model [#ml-model]

New Relic can monitor your machine-learning models. We integrate with many products, such as SageMaker and Aporia. They help you get better ML predictions.


## Alerts [#alerts]

Alerts help you identify issues that look unusual in your applications and code. They show you how these issues affect your users. New Relic includes some alerts when you install it and you can also create your alerts. You receive alerts through tools like PagerDuty and ServiceNow. They can help you stop problems and prevent big disruptions. Being aware of issues early can lead to better user experiences. Let us help you know what's critical, manage the suppressed noise, and mitigate alert fatigue.
