Welcome to the New Relic observability platform! No matter what technology you use, with our platform you can gain deep insights into your systems to solve problems you didn't even know you had. 

Here's a quick overview of our most popular capabilities and features:


# Alerts [#alerts]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>
Alerts help you identify issues that look unusual in your applications and code. New Relic includes some <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> when you install it and you can also create your alerts. You receive alerts through tools like PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Jira, Slack, and more. Let us help you know what's critical, manage the suppressed noise, and mitigate alert fatigue. 
  
Learn more about alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/).

  </SideBySide>

# APM [#apm]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  <img
    title="New Relic APM"
    alt="New Relic APM"
    src={NRApmMain}
  />

  </Side>
  <Side>

  New Relic instruments your application by using one of our many language agents. These agents collect metrics from your application. They send the metrics to <InlinePopover type="apm" />. It lets you monitor it using pre-built dashboards. 
  
  Learn more about APM [here](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/).

  </Side>
  </SideBySide>

# Browser [#browser]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  The <InlinePopover type="browser" /> capability collects data from the navigation timings in all end users' browsers. It sends that data directly to New Relic while blending with the service that served the requests. When you load that page URL, you can easily see which back-end transaction fulfilled that request. 

  Learn more about browser [here](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/).

  </Side>

# Dashboards [#dashboards]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  <img
  title="New Relic dashboards"
  alt="New Relic dashboards"
  src={NRDashboardsMain}
/>

  </Side>
  <Side>

  Our UI allows you to create custom charts and share them easily. Our <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> capability lets you collect and visualize your data preferences across our platform. Tailor your charts to display the information you need. Access and analyze your data from any location within our platform.

  NRQL, short for New Relic query language, is a powerful tool for accessing detailed data from New Relic. NRQL is like SQL. It lets you gather specific info about your applications, hosts, and business operations. By using NRQL, you can gain valuable insights into the performance and behavior of your environment. 

  Learn more about dashboards [here](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) and about NRQL [here](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).

# Infrastructure [#infrastructure]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  The <InlinePopover type="infrastructure" /> capability lets you monitor the health and performance of your service. It covers containers and cloud infrastructure. It includes tracking CPU, memory, network traffic, and disk use. It also includes over 400 on-host integrations for monitoring third-party apps.

  </Side>
  <Side>

  The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability. The data it provides lets you monitor the health of your whole Kubernetes cluster and the performance of your environment. You can check individual pods or drill into specific services and applications. The agent collects telemetry data from your cluster. It uses several New Relic integrations. These include Kubernetes events, the Prometheus Agent, and the New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin.

# OpenTelemetry [#opentelemetry]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  OpenTelemetry helps collect data from your applications and hosts, sending it to New Relic. New Relic's platform lets you analyze the data and fix any application problems. This toolkit simplifies the process of monitoring and troubleshooting your software. By utilizing OpenTelemetry, you can enhance the performance and reliability of your applications.

  Learn more about OpenTelemetry [here](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-get-started-intro/).

  <Side>

  We offer in-depth performance monitoring for your serverless AWS Lambda functions. Our Lambda layer gives one view into the details of your Lambda functions. You can understand what's happening in your serverless apps. Lambda monitoring is serverless. It uses CloudWatch data and code-level tools. They give more in-depth data. 

  Learn more about serverless and Lambda [here](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring/).

# Service levels [#service-levels]
<SideBySide>
  <Side>

  With New Relic, you can set and use service level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) for your applications. Service levels measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. We measure service levels with indicators. We compare them to set objectives for performance and outcomes. 

  Learn more about service levels [here](/docs/service-level-management/intro-slm/).
