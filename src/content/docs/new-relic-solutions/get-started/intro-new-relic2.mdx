# Capabilities [#capabities]

Our platform offers a comprehensive suite of capabilities to help organizations monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the performance of their digital environments. Here's an explanation of New Relic's key capabilities. If you want to learn more, explore our [tutorials](/docs/new-relic-solutions/tutorial-landing-page/) pages. 


## Alerts & AI [#alerts]

Alerts help you identify issues in your applications and code. They show you how these issues affect your users. When you receive notifications of your alerts, you can stop problems and prevent widespread user disruptions. Being aware of issues early can lead to better user experiences.

Let us help you know what's critical, manage the suppressed noise, and mitigate alert fatigue.

## APM & Services [#apm]

New Relic instruments your application at the code level through the use of one of our many language agents. These agents collect metrics from your application and send them to our application performance monitoring (APM) , allowing you to monitor it using pre-built dashboards.

The <InlinePopover type="apm" /> capability provides real-time insights into the performance of applications, services, and microservices across various programming languages and frameworks.

It offers detailed transaction traces, code-level visibility, and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks, optimize application performance, and enhance user experience.

## Browser [#browser]

The <InlinePopover type="browser" /> capability provides insights into the performance and user experience of your web applications, directly within users' browsers.
