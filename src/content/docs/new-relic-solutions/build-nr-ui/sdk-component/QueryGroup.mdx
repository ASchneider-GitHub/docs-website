## QueryGroup

The query group component enables you to parallelize, under a single callback, multiple queries done at once, and get the results of all of them. It can join queries both coming from the SDK and user-made queries, as long as they respect the standard contract:

* Queries accept a `function` as a `children`.
* This function returns an object with at least `loading` (as a `boolean`), `data` (as an object) or `error` (as an `Error` instance).
* Queries should be defined as Pure Components (or implement logic to prevent calling the children function on every render).

Each of the queries is defined declaratively, with the last child of the group being the callback function. This callback function will be called on every query transition with the new state, where each positional argument represents the individual response of the corresponding query.

Each query can individually use a custom `fetchPolicyType`, which will be respected when grouping them.

### Usage

```
import { QueryGroup } from 'nr1'
```



### Examples

#### Example 1

```
<QueryGroup>
  <UserQuery />
  <AccountsQuery />


  {(user, accounts) => {
    if (user.loading || accounts.loading) {
      return <Spinner />;
    }


    // Do stuff with the data!
  }}
</QueryGroup>
```



### Props
