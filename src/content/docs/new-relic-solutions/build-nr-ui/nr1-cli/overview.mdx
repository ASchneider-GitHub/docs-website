Let's build together. With New Relic One, you can build your own components, like apps, and custom visualizations. You can also check out our quick starts and pre-built examples. Create powerful visualizations and add them to your dashboards to see all your data in one place. 

To build a New Relic app, you need to [install the New Relic One CLI](#install-nr-one-cli). The CLI helps you build, publish, and manage your New Relic app. This page is about the use of [CLI commands](##nr-one-cli-commands) that you can use:

- Generate Nerdpack and Nerdlet templates.

- Locally serve Nerdpacks when developing.

- Publish and deploy.

- Subscribe to Nerdpacks.

- Add screenshots and metadata to the catalog.


## Installing the New Relic One CLI [#install-nr-one-cli]

To install the New Relic One CLI follow these instructions:

1. Go to New Relic to open the [Build on New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) page.

    <img
    title="Build on New Relic"
    alt="Build on New Relic"
    src={buildNR}
    />

2. Follow the quick start instructions.

The quick start generates an API key for your chosen account. It provides pre-populated commands to create a profile, build your first `Hello World` app, and deploy it locally. This simplifies the process and saves you time. You can get started quickly without having to set everything up manually. Just follow the steps provided and you'll be up and running in no time.
