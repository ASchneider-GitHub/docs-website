Curious how your app is performing on the latest Android or iOS release? Use our OS versions page to analyze and compare app performance between different releases (including major and minor releases), and view metrics like number of active devices, network failures, and HTTP request time.

## View the OS versions page [#view-os-versions-page]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. In the left-hand menu, click **OS versions**.

## Understand performance metrics [#understand-perfomance-metrics]

If you see a data spike, such as an increase in interaction time, click and drag the time picker. The page will refresh and expand into that segment of time so you can see exactly what happened.

Click into a specific OS version to view performance metrics.

## Create NRQL queries and alerts [#create-queries-alerts]

You can [create NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) using these attributes:

* To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use `install`. This attribute records `true` for new installations.
* To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use `upgradeFrom`.

Once you've created a NRQL query, you can [create a custom chart and get alerts for changes in data](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create-chart).
