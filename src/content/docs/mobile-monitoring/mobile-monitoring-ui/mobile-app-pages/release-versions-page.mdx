## Create NRQL queries and alerts [#create-queries-alerts]

You can [create NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) using these attributes:

* To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use `install`. This attribute records `true` for new installations.
* To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use `upgradeFrom`.

Once you've created a NRQL query, you can [create a custom chart and get alerts for changes in data](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create-chart).
