What is Android Dynamic Feature?

Android dynamic features refer to a functionality introduced by the Android platform that allows developers to modularize their applications and deliver specific features on-demand.

The New Relic Gradle plugin introduces the ability to customize plugin task behavior for Android dynamic feature modules during the build process. To implement this feature, create a plugin extension in the Gradle build files that applies the New Relic plugin to the dynamic feature module. You can then make use of various configuration options available for customization.

</Callout>

To enable the Android Gradle Plugin and Agent for Android Dynamic Feature Module: Add the following to your Feature Module's `build.gradle`:

```gradle

apply plugin: 'com.android.dynamic-feature'
apply plugin: 'newrelic'

android {

    compileSdkVersion versions.compileSdk
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion versions.minSdk
        targetSdkVersion versions.targetSdk
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation project(':app')
    compileOnly 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:7.3.0'
}

```
