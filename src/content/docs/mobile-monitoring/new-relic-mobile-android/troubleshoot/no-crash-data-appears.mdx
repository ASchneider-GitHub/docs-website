Here is a rewritten version of your text, following the New Relic documentation guidelines:

*No Crash Data Appears in Release Build (Android)*
======================================================
### Problem
After an app crash, no crash data appears in the New Relic UI. You may see logs indicating that the Agent is unable to find the `buildId`, which is required for crashes to be processed on the New Relic side.

**Console Agent Logs to Verify the Issue:**

* `Agent.getBuildId() was unable to find a valid build Id. Crashes and handled exceptions will not be accepted.`
* `Invalid (null or empty build ID detected! Crash will be ignored by collector.`
* `ExceptionHelper: java.util.UUID:fromStringJava8(UUID.java:337) RandomUUID[java.lang.IllegalArgumentException] Invalid UUID string: `
* `Unable to get obfuscated flag in crash`

### Solution
If no crash data appears after an app crash, please follow these steps:

#### 1. Verify Gradle and AGP Versions

 Ensure you're using:
* Gradle Version **7.5 or higher**
* AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) Version ** **1999)

#### 2. Configure ProGuard Rules

Double that proper ProGuard rules are added to your ProGuard configuration file. Refer to the [Configuring ProGuard Rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-proguard-or-dexguard-android-apps/) section in the setup documentation for guidance.
