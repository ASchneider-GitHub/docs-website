We recommend that you use our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0qwLv87gkj5) to set up iOS monitoring. However, if you need to install the agent manually, follow the steps below to install the New Relic iOS agent by downloading the xcframework.

## Manually add the iOS agent to your project

Follow these steps to install an XCFramework into your Xcode project:

1. Download the latest iOS agent from our [iOS agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes).
2. Navigate to where the iOS agent was downloaded and unzip it.
3. Add the iOS agent XCFramework to your project:
    - Right-click on the **"Project Navigator"** area.
    - Select **"Add Files to [YourProjectName]"**.
    - Navigate to the location of the XCFramework on your disk.
    - Select the NewRelic.xcframework directory and click **"Add"**.

4. Embed the iOS agent xcframework:
    - Select your project in the Project Navigator to open the project and target settings.
    - Click on the target to which you want to add the XCFramework.
    - Go to the **"General"** tab.
    - Scroll down to the **"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"** section.
    - Make sure the NewRelic.xcframework is listed here. If it's not, click the **"+"** button and add it.
