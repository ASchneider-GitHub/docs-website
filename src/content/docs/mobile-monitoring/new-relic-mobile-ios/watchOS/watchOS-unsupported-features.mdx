Apple does not provide the all the same APIs to watchOS platform. Because of this some of the features that the iOS agent provides are not available on watchOS. We seek to have parity in our platforms so as Apple releases new functionality we will continue to investigate solutions.

## Known Unsupported Features:
- Crash Handling
  - The third party library the agent uses, PLCrashReporter, is not compatible with watchOS.
- Crash Count
  - Because crashes are not reported on watchOS there will be no crash count.
- Handled exceptions
  - The agent will capture and upload handled exceptions but NR One currently is not displaying them.
- Background harvesting 
  - If NRFeatureFlag_BackgroundReporting is enabled the agent will continue to monitor the application but will not harvest and upload to NR One while in background.
- Offline marked events
  - If NRFeatureFlag_OfflineStorage is enabled the agent will store offline harvests and then send them when online but the events created in an offline state won't be marked as such in the attributes.
- Hot/Cold app start times
  - The UIKit notifications the agent relies on to capture this information are not available for watchOS.
