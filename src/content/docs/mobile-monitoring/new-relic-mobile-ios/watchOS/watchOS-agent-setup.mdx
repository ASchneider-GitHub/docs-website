WatchOS projects do not normally contain an `ApplicationDelegate` or `ExtensionDelegate` class. These delegates are necessary to configure and start the New Relic agent in a watchOS project. Before adding the AppDelegate, follow the [outlined procedure](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/spm-installation) to correctly install the New Relic agent. 

## Update your watchOS application [#watchOS_App]

To add an `AppDelegate` to your watchOS application, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `WatchAppDelegate.swift` to add to your project.
1. Add a class named `WatchAppDelegate` that inherits from `NSObject`. This class should conform to the `WKApplicationDelegate` protocol. 
1. Add the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` function to the `WatchAppDelegate` class. 
1. As close to the start of the`applicationDidFinishLaunching` function, add `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")`. Be sure to replace `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).

Here is an example of what your `WatchAppDelegate.swift` file might look like:

    ```swift
    import WatchKit
    import NewRelic
        
    class WatchAppDelegate: NSObject, WKApplicationDelegate {
        func applicationDidFinishLaunching() {
                NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")
                return true
            }
        }
    ```
<Callout variant="important">
    To ensure proper instrumentation, you must start the agent on the first line of `applicationDidFinishLaunching()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
</Callout>


1. In the main app structure object add the following line: `@WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor var appDelegate: WatchAppDelegate`. 

 ```swift
import NewRelic

@main
struct Watch_App: App {
    @WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor var appDelegate: WatchAppDelegate
 ```


## WatchOS Extension [#watchOS_Extention]

1. Add the `WKExtensionDelegateClassName` key in your WatchKit extensionâ€™s Info.plist file. This will create a delegate object automatically named `ExtensionDelegate`. For more information [WKExtensionDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkextensiondelegate).
1. In the `ExtensionDelegate` class you created, add the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` function. 
1. As close to the start of `applicationDidFinishLaunching` as possible add `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")` replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).

<Callout variant="important">
    To ensure proper instrumentation, you must start the agent on the first line of `applicationDidFinishLaunching()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
</Callout>
    
```swift
import WatckKit
import NewRelic
    
class ExtensionDelegate: NSObject, WKExtensionDelegate {
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching() {
            NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")
            return true
        }
    }
```

These instructions are all you need to do to start the New Relic agent in the recommended way in your watchOS project.
