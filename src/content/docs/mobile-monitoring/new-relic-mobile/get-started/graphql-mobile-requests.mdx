Monitor your GraphQL mobile requests.

Unlike REST API requests, all GraphQL requests go to one `/graphql` endpoint, which makes it difficult to monitor requests that may perform different actions. You can configure your integration so you see different GraphQL requests broken out by "Group By" in New Relic. This will give you a clearer picture of how your GraphQL API is being used and help you to identify any potential performance issues.

## Add custom names to GraphQL requests [#custom-instrumentation]

New Relic automatically captures requests with the following headers:

* `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME`
* `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-TYPE`
* `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-ID`

To custom name your GraphQL requests based on their actions, you'll need to add the name as a `operationName` value. The value must meet the following requirements:

* Be a string with a length between 1 and 1024 characters
* Consist exclusively of [ASCII characters](https://www.ascii-code.com/characters)

### Examples [#examples]

For example, if your requests are sent from `https://myMobileApp.com/graphql`, and you set the `operationName` header to `checkout`, all request data will be sent to New Relic and viewed as `checkout`.

See the language-specific examples below based on your mobile app platform.

   newRequestBuilder.addHeader("operationName","LaunchList")
   Request newRequest = newRequestBuilder.build();

## View data in New Relic [#view-data]

To view your request data: 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. On the left-hand menu, click **HTTP requests**.
4. In the **Group by** dropdown, select **Operation Name**. The HTTP requests page will show just the request names you set as the `operationName`.

Now that you're looking at just your GraphQL requests, click into a specific request to see how it's impacting your overall app experience.
