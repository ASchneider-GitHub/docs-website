In the dynamic realm of mobile app development, GraphQL has emerged as a transformative force, enabling developers to build powerful and streamlined data fetching tools. However, with the increasing complexity of GraphQL queries and the intricacies of mobile app architecture, the need for comprehensive monitoring has become even more important. New Relic can help you monitor GraphQL requests so you can:

* Identify and optimize queries that are causing delays or performance slowdowns.

* Proactively catch errors before they impact users.

* Ensure data loads quickly and smoothly from end-user requests.

## Get started [#get-started]

By default, New Relic monitors all your GraphQL requests, but we recommend you manually configuring the name of your GraphQL requests to parse out requests that perform different actions and view performance data for the different "groups" of requests. This is because unlike REST APIs, all GraphQL requests go to one `/graphql` endpoint, which makes it difficult to parse out requests that perform different actions. By giving custom names to your requests, you'll get a a clearer picture of how your GraphQL API is being used and help you to identify any potential performance issues of specific request functions.


To custom name your GraphQL requests, you'll need to:

1. Determine the specific network request that New Relic should capture.

2. Use the `addHTTPHeadersTracking method` to set the `X-APOLLO-OPERATION-NAME` header for the identified request. The value must meet the following requirements:

* Be a string with a length between 1 and 1024 characters
* Consist exclusively of [ASCII characters](https://www.ascii-code.com/characters)

See the language-specific examples below based on your mobile app platform, making sure to replace `operationName` with your custom name.

   //add GraphQL operation name as Header and we automatically add that header for your

   newRequestBuilder.addHeader("operationName","LaunchList")
   Request newRequest = newRequestBuilder.build();

## View data in New Relic [#view-data]

To view your GraphQL requests: 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. On the left-hand menu, click **HTTP requests**.
4. In the **Group by** dropdown, select **Operation Name**. The HTTP requests page will show just the request names you set as the `operationName`.

Now that you're looking at just your GraphQL requests, click into a specific request to see metrics on response time and network failure.
