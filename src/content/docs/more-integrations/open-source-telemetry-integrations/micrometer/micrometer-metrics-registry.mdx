You can configure the OpenTelemetry (OTel) bridge to forward Micrometer data to New Relic. The OTel Micrometer bridge directs Micrometer to record telemetry to OTel, which you can then export to New Relic with the OpenTelemtry SDK. 

This doc walks you through procedures to forward Micrometer data with an example Spring app. These are generalized steps that you may want to update to fit your specific environment. 

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

Before you get started, we recommend that you:

* A Springboot app with Micrometer enabled. Your Springboot app should be instrumented with Micrometer out of the box.
* Review the [Getting started](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide/capitalization/product-capability-feature-usage/) section of the OpenTelemetry Java instrumentation repo. 
* At minimum, ensure your OTel Java agent is the latest version.
