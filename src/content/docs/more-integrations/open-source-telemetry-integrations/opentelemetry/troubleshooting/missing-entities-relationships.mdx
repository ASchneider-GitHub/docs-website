## Problem

You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component, and either the [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) or its [relationships](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#related-entities) are missing or incorrect in the UI.

## Solution

OpenTelemetry entities are synthesized based on the public rules described for the [`EXT-SERVICE`](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/blob/b8e75d839eed7859044a9bb601a62e5323107350/definitions/ext-service/definition.yml) entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the `service.name` dimension (which follows the OpenTelemetry [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/527206ea49e384de957eda105d9425aa8fefca25/specification/overview.md#semantic-conventions)).

* For Java, include the  `service.name` in your resource:

```java
var resource = Resource.getDefault()
    .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build());
```

        The following suites of attributes are defined by the [OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/527206ea49e384de957eda105d9425aa8fefca25/specification/overview.md#semantic-conventions). These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK.

            * `service.*` attributes
                * `service.name` attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI
                * `service.instance.id` is required for certain panes to light up
            * `telemetry.sdk.language=java` is required to see data in the JVM section
        </Callout>

* For all other SDK languages, set `service.name` by declaring it in the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` or `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` [environment variables](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/20c82de552d08428e8cadaaef3e6cb46812f7c00/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md#general-sdk-configuration).

For New Relic <InlinePopover type="logs" />, you can use a structured log template to inject the `service.name`. See [Logs in context with Log4j2](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/blob/e3f5ee85b4dcd8dd29f8f69d78d122b82a9638ba/other-examples/java/logs-in-context-log4j2/Log4j2EventLayout.json#L2) for an example.
