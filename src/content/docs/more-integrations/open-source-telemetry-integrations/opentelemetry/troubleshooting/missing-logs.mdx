## Problem

You've correlated your logs with your service using `service.name`([OpenTelemetry logs: Best practices](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs)) so you can see logs associated with traces, but you don't see any logs in the New Relic UI. In this scenario, the log data has made it to New Relic, but isn't showing up in the distributed trace UI with corresponding spans.

## Solution

To correlate your logs with trace data, the logs need to include the trace context that is contained `trace_id` and `span_id`. However, to ensure your logs show up in the New Relic UI, you'll need to configure rules in your log pipeline to translate `trace_id` and `span_id` to `trace.id` and `span.id`.
