## Problem

You’re using an OpenTelemetry collector to send data to New Relic, but you’re experiencing issues like:
* The collector exits or restarts
* The collector is not receiving data
* New Relic is not receiving data
* Processing/exporting data is not working


## Solution

For solutions to common collector problems, see the [OpenTelemetry troubleshooting documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/troubleshooting/).

Within New Relic, we recommend using this NRQL query to show all collector metrics sent to New Relic:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName like ‘otelcol_%’ LIMIT MAX
```
