To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. New Relic supports `gzip` and `zstd` compression for OTLP payloads transported via gRPC or HTTP. 
The maximum allowed payload size is 1MB (10^6 bytes).

## OTel collector configuration
`zstd` compression is considered more efficient than `gzip` which is currently the default compression for the OTLP exporter in the OTel collector. See [compression comparison](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md#compression-comparison) for details benchmark information.

To enable `zstd` in the collector adapt the collector exporter config:

```
exporters:
  otlp:
    ...
    compression: zstd

```

If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP). Note that you can [sign up for CNCF's Slack account here](https://slack.cncf.io/).
