The OpenTelemetry APM UI is a curated experience available for [service entities][service entity attributes]. See [Find OpenTelemetry APM services](#find-opentelemetry-apm-services) to find OpenTelemetry APM entities in New Relic.

The OpenTelemetry APM UI pages are designed to help quickly identify and diagnose problems. Many require data to conform to various [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/), but some are general purpose. See details on requirements for each page below:

- [Summary page](#summary-page)
- [Distributing tracing page](#distributed-tracing-page)
- [Service map page](#service-map-page)
- [Transactions page](#transactions-page)
- [Databases page](#databases-page)
- [External services page](#externals-page)
- [JVM runtime page](#jvm-runtime-page)
- [Go runtime page](#go-runtime-page)
- [Logs page](#logs-page)
- [Errors inbox page](#errors-inbox-page)
- [Metrics explorer page](#metrics-explorer-page)

Certain concepts recur or have overlap across pages:

- [Golden signals](#golden-signals)
- [Narrow data with filters](#narrow-data-with-filters)
- [Metrics or Spans Toggle](#metrics-spans-toggle)

## Find OpenTelemetry APM services

To find OpenTelemetry APM services, navigate to **All entities -> Services - OpenTelemetry** or **APM & Services**. Click on a service to navigate to the service's [summary page](#summary-page).

Within the entity explorer, you can filter by [entity tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/). See [OpenTelemetry resources in New Relic](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources) for details on how entity tags are computed.

## Page: Summary [#summary-page]

The summary page provides an overview of your service's health, including:

- **Golden signals:** response time, throughput, and error rate. See [golden signals](#golden-signals).
- **Related entities:** other services communicating with this service and related infrastructure. See [service map](#service-map) for a details view.
- **Activity:** status of any alerts active for this service.
- **Distributed tracing insights:** discover whether downstream or upstream entities might be contributing to degraded performance. See [related trace entity signals](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/related-trace-entity-signals/) for more details.
- **Instances:** breakdown of golden signals by instance when a service is scaled horizontally. Depends on the `service.instance.id` resource attribute (see [service entity attributes][] for more details).

## Page: Distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing-page]

The distributed tracing page provides detailed insights into OpenTelemetry trace data. See [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui/) for page usage information. See [OpenTelemetry traces in New Relic] for general information about OpenTelemetry trace data.

As with [golden signals](#golden-signals), spans are classified as an error if the span status is set to `ERROR` (i.e. `otel.status_code = ERROR`). If the span is an error, the span status description (i.e. `otel.status_description`) is displayed in "Error details".

OpenTelemetry span events attach additional event context information to a specific span. They are most commonly used to capture exception information. If available, you can view a span's events in "trace details". Note, the presence of a span exception event doesn't quality the span as an error on its own. Only span's with span status set to `ERROR` are classified as an error.

## Page: Service map [#service-map-page]

The service map page provides a visual representation of your entire architecture. See [service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/service-maps/) for more information.

## Page: Transactions [#transactions-page]

The transactions page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing with specific [transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/#txn-defined).

For **metrics**, the queries assume data conforms to the [http metric][] or [rpc metric][] semantic conventions. The `http.route` and `rpc.method` attributes are used for listing and filtering by transaction.

For **spans**, the queries are generic, utilizing only the top level span data model. Spans are counted towards transaction throughput and response time as described in [golden signals](#golden-signals). The span name field is used for listing and filtering by transaction.

## Page: Databases [#databases-page]

The databases page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a service's database client operations.

There is no **metrics** based view of databases since there are currently no semantic conventions available.

For **spans**, the queries assume data conforms to the [db span](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/database-spans/) semantic conventions. The span name, and `db.system`, `db.sql.table`, and `db.operation` attributes are listing and filtering database operations.

## Page: External services [#externals-page]

The externals page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a service's external calls, including calling entities (upstream services) and called entities (downstream services).

There is no **metrics** based view of the external services page.

For **spans**, the queries are generic, utilizing only the top level span data model. Spans are counted towards external service throughput and response time if they are exiting a service, computed using a heuristic of `WHERE span.kind = client OR span.kind = producer`. Database client spans are filtered out where `db.system is null` (see [databases page](#databases-page)). Spans are errors if they have a status code of `ERROR` (i.e. `otel.status_code = ERROR`). If available, data from the [http span] and [rpc span] semantic conventions are used to classify external service calls.

## Page: JVM runtime [#jvm-runtime-page]

The JVMs runtime page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a Java service's JVM. The page is only displayed for services using [OpenTelemetry java](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/). In order to differentiate between distinct JVM instances, the page requires the `service.instance.id` resource attribute to be set (see [service entity attributes] for more details).

The JVM runtime page shows golden signals alongside JVM runtime metrics to correlate JVM issues with service usage. The [span-metrics](#metrics-spans-toggle) toggle dictates whether the [golden signals](#golden-signals) are driven by span or metric data. There is no **spans** based view for JVM runtime metrics.

For **metrics**, the queries assume data conforms to the [jvm metric](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/jvm-metrics/) semantic conventions. Note, these conventions are embodied in [OpenTelemetry Java runtime instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime-telemetry/runtime-telemetry-java8/library), which is automatically included with the OpenTelemetry java agent.

## Page: Go runtime [#go-runtime-page]

The Go runtime page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a Java service's JVM. The page is only displayed for services using [OpenTelemetry Go](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/). In order to differentiate between distinct JVM instances, the page requires the `service.instance.id` resource attribute to be set (see [service entity attributes] for more details).

The Go runtime page shows golden signals alongside JVM runtime metrics to correlate Go runtime issues with service usage. The [span-metrics](#metrics-spans-toggle) toggle dictates whether the [golden signals](#golden-signals) are driven by span or metric data. There is no **spans** based view for Go runtime metrics.

For **metrics**, the queries assume data is produced by the [OpenTelemetry Go runtime instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime). Note, there are currently no semantic conventions for go runtime metrics.

## Page: Logs [#logs-page]

The Logs page provides tools for identifying problems from and analyzing an service's logs. The [logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) for more information.

## Page: Errors inbox [#errors-inbox-page]

The Errors nbox page provides tools for detecting and triaging a service's errors. See [error inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/) for more details.

The Errors inbox page is driven by trace deta. As with [golden signals](#golden-signals), spans are classified as an error if the span status is set to `ERROR` (i.e. `otel.status_code = ERROR`).

Error spans are grouped together by their error fingerprint, computed by normalizing away identifying values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses, etc. Each distinct error span is an individual instance within the error group. The error group message is determine as follows:

- span status description (i.e. `otel.status_description`)
- `rpc.grpc.status_code` from [rpc span][] semantic conventions
- `http.status_code` from [http span][] semantic conventions
- `undefined` if none of the above are present

## Page: Metrics explorer [#metrics-explorer-page]

The Metrics explorer provides tools for exploring service metrics in a generic manner. See [explore your data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/#explore-data) for more information.

## Golden signals [#golden-signals]

The golden signals of throughput, response time, and error rate appear in several places throughout the OpenTelemetry APM UI. When used, they are computed as follows:

For **metrics**, the queries assume data conforms to the [http metric][] or [rpc metric][] semantic conventions.

For **spans**, the queries are generic, utilizing only the top level span data model. Spans are counted towards throughput and response time if they are root entry spans into a service, computed using a heuristic of `WHERE span.kind = server OR span.kind = consumer`. Spans are errors if they have a status code of `ERROR` (i.e. `otel.status_code = ERROR`).

## Narrow data with filters

Several pages include a filter bar (i.e. **Narrow data to..**). This allows you to filter all panels on the page to match the criteria. For example, you might narrow to a particular canary deployment by filtering for `service.version='1.2.3-canary'`. Filters are preserved when navigating between pages.

## Metrics or spans toggle [#metrics-spans-toggle]

Various pages include a span-metrics toggle. This allows you to toggle whether the panels are driven by span or metric data based on analysis requirements and data availability.

Metrics are not subject to sampling, and are thus more accurate, especially when computing rates like throughput. However, metrics are subject to cardinality constraints, and may lack certain attributes important for analysis. In contrast, spans are sampled and thus subject to accuracy issues, but have richer attributes since they are not subject to cardinality constraints.

Historically, OpenTelemetry language APIs / SDKs and instrumentation prioritized span instrumentation. However, the project has come a long way and [metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) are available in almost all languages. Check the documentation of the relevant language and instrumentation for more details.
