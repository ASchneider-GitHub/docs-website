Beginning September 25, 2024, we are removing the ability to copy API keys from [the UI](https://get.newrelic.com/MzQxLVhLUC0zMTAAAAGUiZ8sq6uwzvQMEjtdfLs43rOhHFRYwkHxXjt8wYs2qCJP2IkoVpEZiGhCVneo-hfy1Ucijgo=). The “copy key” option in the drop-down seen below will be removed. This applies to user and license keys, both new and existing. If you have an automation that is dependent on scraping keys from the UI, please integrate using the NerdGraph API.

You are still able to retrieve your new and existing API keys through our [NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-user-keys/#query-keys).

## What you need to do

Before **September 25, 2024**: you will need to store your existing API keys (both user and license keys) in a secure location outside New Relic, if you haven't done that already. **If you do not take this step, you will no longer be able to access existing API keys from our UI.**

After September 25, 2024: when generating new API keys (both user and license keys), you will need to copy the key to a secure location outside New Relic before leaving the page.

For more information, [see our docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#copy-keys).
