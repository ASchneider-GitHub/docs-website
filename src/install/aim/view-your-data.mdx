 Send a prompt to your AI assistant, wait a few minutes, then check New Relic for your data. You can find your AI data in APM & Services: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > APM & Services]()** to view the APM summary page. From there, find **AI Monitoring** in the left nav. 

 We recommend starting with **AI Responses** to confirm data is reporting.
