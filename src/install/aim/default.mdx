To get data about your AI app, you need to install an APM agent that can collect and send data to New Relic. We have two methods to install the APM agent:

* You can install by manually updating your app code with some code.
* You can use our CLI installer that inspects your system and installs the agent for you.

Either option gets you started, but we recommend the guided install if you're a smaller organization or you're trying out New Relic for the first time.
