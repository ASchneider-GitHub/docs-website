To start monitoring your AI stack, you need to install one of our language agents. By installing, you authorize our agents to attach to your app through a process called instrumentation. Once an agent instruments your app, it can capture data about how a request passes through your AI toolchain, giving you insight into how the individual components of your toolchain perform. 

The install process looks like this:

1. Instrument your AI-powered app with an agent. Even if you've installed the agent before in another app, you still need to instrument your AI-powered app.
2. Make additional configurations to the agent. These configurations let you choose the kinds of data you want ingested by New Relic.
3. Confirm that the agent is reporting data by checking New Relic. 

Follow the steps below to install the agent.
