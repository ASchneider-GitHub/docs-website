AI Monitoring (AIM) lets you track the performance of the different apps, services, and databases that make up your AI assistant. When your AI responds to a prompt, the response contains a payload, which is made up of bits of data and decision points that New Relic can monitor. Instrumenting your AI-powered app allows us to ingest that data, letting you monitor and improve your AI assistant.

Setting up involves installing one of our language agents and enabling AI Monitoring at the config level. When you're done, your AI data will appear in our UI.
