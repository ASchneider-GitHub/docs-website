AI monitoring lets you track the performance of the different apps, services, and databases that inform your AI assistant's decisions. When your AI receives a prompt, AI monitoring captures how your AI generates its response, letting you dig deep into traces, performance metrics, and logs. 

To get started, you'll install one of our language agents, then enable AI monitoring at the config level.

<Callout variant="tip">
Keep in mind that you need to enable distributed tracing for AI monitoring: `distributed_tracing.enabled = true` If `distributed_tracing.enabled` is set to `false`, your AI monitoring data will be limited.
