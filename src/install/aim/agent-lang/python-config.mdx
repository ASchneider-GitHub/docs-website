There are a few configuration settings we recommend when using AI monitoring. 
By default, the Python agent will truncate attribute values once they are larger than 255 characters. In the case of AI monitoring, when large messages are being sent back and forth to the UI, this can result in truncated messages and lost context. To increase this value, you can adjust the following settings. We recommend the maximum value of 4095.

Using environment variables:

```
NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
= YOUR_VALUE
```

Via agent configuration file:

```yml
custom_insights_events.max_attribute_value = YOUR_VALUE>
```

Additionally, a single instance of the Python agent will send a maximum of 100,000 machine learning events per minute to New Relic. Once this maximum is reached, the agent will begin sampling to give a general representation of events across the harvest cycle. To modify the this event reservoir value, you can adjust the following configuration setting:

Using environment variables:


```
NEW_RELIC_ML_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED = YOUR_VALUE
```

With the agent config file:

```yml
event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.ml_event_data = YOUR_VALUE
```

We also strongly recommend that you have the following configurations enabled:

* `application_logging.enabled` - Allows us to capture application logs and correlate them with LLM calls
* `application_logging.forwarding.enabled` - Automatically forwards application logs to New Relic (if you have another log forwarding setup, you can use that instead)
* `distributed_tracing.enabled` - Enables distributed tracing so that we can understand your application's LLM usage in the context of your overall architecture
