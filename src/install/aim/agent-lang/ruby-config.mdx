AI Monitoring introduces two new configuration options to the Ruby agent: 

* `ai_monitoring.enabled`, default: `true` 
Indicates whether LLM instrumentation will be registered. If this is set to `false`, no metrics, events, or spans related to AI Monitoring will be sent. Currently, this equates to the same thing as `instrumentation.ruby_openai`, but as we add support for more AI monitoring libraries, you can use this configuration as a overall switch to disable instrumentation for them as well. This configuration is set to `false` when high security mode is enabled.

* `instrumentation.ruby_openai`, default: `auto`
This configuration controls the way instrumentation for the `ruby-openai` gem is installed in your application. `auto` will default to adding the instrumentation via module prepending and is the same as setting this value to `prepend`. Other valid options are `chain`, to install the instrumentation with alias method chaining, and `disabled` which will skip instrumentation. The instrumentation will only attempt to install if `ai_monitoring.enabled` is true, and your application uses a version of `ruby-openai` >= 3.4.0.
