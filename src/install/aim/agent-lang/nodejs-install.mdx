If your AI-powered app is written in Node.js, then this step has you install the Node agent. You have a few different options for installation:

* Our [guided install](https://staging.onenr.io/0kERzE1edwr) installs the infrastructure agent to inspect your environment first, then installs various technologies to match your environment, including the Node.js agent. 
* You can follow our [in-app install flow](https://staging.onenr.io/0Zyw4Bmm0j3) that only installs the Node.js agent. If you're looking to only monitor your AI app, you'd choose this option. 
* You can [set up the agent manually](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) by installing the New Relic package, copying the agent config file into the root directory of your app, then adding some code to your start-up script. This gives you more oversight into the instrumentation process, but takes time. You receive the same agent out of the box as you would choosing the second option. 

After you've installed the agent, return to this doc to apply configurations that let you capture AI data. If you want to configure at a later date, bookmark the [Node.js configurations doc]() to return to the next step later.
