You need to install the Node.js agent and enable AIM with agent configurations. You have two options for installation:

* You can use our [CLI installer](https://onenr.io/08woW9VWbwx), which installs both the infrastructure and Node.js agents. We recommend this option if you're trying out New Relic for the first time. 
* You can follow our manual installation procedures in our [Node.js installation doc](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent). This is a good option if you're looking for a permanent, scalable solution for your environment. 

When you've finished all of the procedures in your install, return to this doc to configure your agent to recognize AI data. Keep in mind that you need to enable AI Monitoring for the agent to recognize and correlate AI data from your APM data.
