You installed a Node agent in the last step, but your agent hasn't been configured to collect AI data like LLM events. This step has you apply those configurations so AIM initializes at app runtime. 

We recommend applying these configurations from `newrelic.js`. If you have a more complex set up with multiple environments, you can configure with environment variables: 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="config-file"
        title="Enable with config file"
    >

        ```js
        ai_monitoring: {
            enabled: true
        }
        ```   

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="config-enviro"
        title="Enable with environment variables"
    >

                ```bash
                NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
                ```
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
