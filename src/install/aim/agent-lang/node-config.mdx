After you have installed the Node.js agent, you will need to turn on the following configuration settings.  The ai_monitoring flag enables instrumentation and sending of the LLM events.  The increase in custom insights events allows for all the LLM events to be sent to New Relic.

Using environment variables:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=10000
```

Using the agent configuration file:

```yml
ai_monitoring.enabled = true
Custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored = 10000
```
