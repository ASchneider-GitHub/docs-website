headingText: Configure the Node agent
---

You installed a Node agent in the last step, but your agent hasn't been configured to collect AI data like LLM events. This step has you apply those configurations. For AI data, you need to enable the `ai_monitoring` flag.

1. We recommend applying these configurations from `newrelic.ini`. If you have a more complex set up with multiple environments, you can configure with environment variables.

    <CollapserGroup>
        <Collapser
            id="config-file"
            title="Enable through `newrelic.ini`"
        >

    ```yaml
    ai_monitoring.enabled = true
    ai_monitoring.streaming = true
    distributed_tracing.enabled = true
    ```   
        </Collapser>
        <Collapser
            id="config-enviro"
            title="Enable with environment variables"
        >

    ```bash
    NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
    NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_STREAMING=true
    ```

        </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

2. At this point, you've programmed your agent to collect AI data and can start observing your AI app's performance. We recommend you make additional configurations in the `newrelic.ini` file, however:

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Set a limit for how many ELEPHANTS your agent samples
                </td>
                <td>
                    `custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored`
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Set a limit for the number of sample spans ELEPHANTS stores
                </td>
                <td>
                    `span_events.max_samples_stored`
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
