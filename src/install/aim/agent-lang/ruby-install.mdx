You need to install the Ruby agent and enable AI monitoring with agent configurations. Follow our install procedures in our [Ruby installation doc](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent).

When you've finished all of the procedures in your install, return to this doc to configure your agent to recognize AI data. Keep in mind that you need to enable AI monitoring for the agent to recognize and correlate AI data from your APM data.
