If your AI-powered app is written in Python, then this step has you install the Python agent. You have a few different options for installation:

* Our [guided install](https://staging.onenr.io/0kERzE1edwr) installs the infrastructure agent to inspect your environment first, then installs various technologies to match your environment, including the Python agent. If you're interested in complete instrumentation of apps and services outside your AI-app, choose this flow. 
* You can [set up the agent manually](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) by installing the New Relic package, then integrating the agent into your app. Since Python has different host and framework options, we recommend using our manual install to get the most accurate procedures for your environment. 

Keep in mind that manual install only instruments one app with one Python agent, so if you need additional instrumentation, then we recommend guided install. 

After you've installed the agent, return to this doc to apply configurations that let you capture AI data. If you want to configure at a later date, bookmark the [Python configurations doc]() to return to the next step later.
