You need to install the Python agent and enable AIM with agent configurations. You have two options for installation:

* You can use our [CLI installer](https://onenr.io/08woW9VWbwx), which installs both the infrastructure and Python agents. We recommend this option if you're trying out New Relic for the first time. 
* You can follow our manual installation procedures in our [Python installation doc](/install/python/). This is a good option if you're looking for a permanent, scalable solution for your environment.
