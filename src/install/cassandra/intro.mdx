Our Cassandra integration sends performance [metrics](#metrics) and [inventory data](#inventory) from your Cassandra database to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Cassandra metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your Cassandra instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.
