**Note:** Make sure that the target application is stopped prior to installing the extension.

Installing the extension:
1. Click the app services tile
2. Click the name of the target application in the displayed list
3. On the options listed on the left, scroll down to "Extensions" located under the `Development Tools` category
4. Click on `+ Add` at the top of the page
5. From the extension drop down, select `New Relic Java Agent`
6. Click on the `Accept Legal Terms` link
7. Click `OK` on the bottom left of the page
8. Again, click `OK` on the bottom left of the page; this will begin installation of the extension

Once installed, the extension creates the following artifacts:
    - Folder: `C:\home\NewRelic\JavaAgent\newrelic` - Contains the Java agent artifacts (jars, sources, etc)
    - XDT: `applicationHost.xdt` that will add the necessary `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable on application startup

If the extension fails to install, a log file is created at `C:\home\SiteExtensions\NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension.JavaAgent\install.log`.

Configuring the extension:
1. On the options listed on the left, scroll down to "Configuration" located under the `Settings` category
2. On the configuration page, add the following two app settings:
    - `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` - Your New Relic license key value
    - `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` - The name you wish your application to show up as in the New Relic Platform

You can also add any additional [app settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Environment_Variables) to configure the agent as needed.
