## Configure buffer size and interval [#buffer-settings]

When selecting our Kinesis Firehose integration for logs in AWS, the wizard hides a small section called `Buffer hints` at the bottom of the screen. This section contains two very important configuration options: `Buffer size` and `Buffer interval`.

The default values are 5 MiB for `Buffer size`, and 60 seconds for `Buffer interval`. This means that Firehose accumulates logs until either they contain 5 MiB of data, or until 60 seconds have passed since the last time they were flushed to New Relic.

<Callout variant="important">
  These default settings are not appropriate for log management in New Relic. We strongly advise to use 1 MiB as the `Buffer size` and activate GZIP body compression.
</Callout>

Why do we recommend this? New Relic accepts at most [payloads of 1 MB](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#limits) (1.000.000 bytes) for an individual HTTP POST request to its Logs API. If the size of the accumulated logs exceeds 1 MB during any 60-second accumulation period, we will reject those logs with a `413` HTTP error.

The delivery stream allows configuring, at a minimum, a buffer size of 1 MiB (1.048.576 bytes). Even though this value is slightly greater than the 1MB allowed by New Relic's Logs API, you can use GZIP compression so that the resulting payload becomes smaller than the 1MB limit.
