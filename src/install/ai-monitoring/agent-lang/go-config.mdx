To collect AI data, you need to ensure that certain configurations are enabled when you instrument your AI-powered app. We also recommend updating other variables to improve data retention.

* We recommend applying these configurations in the New Relic config file. 
* If you have a more complex set up with multiple environments, you can configure with environment variables.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="config"
        title="Configure through `newrelic.Config`"
    >

        ```go
        
        ```

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="environment"
        title="Configure with environment variables"
    >

    ```bash
    NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_ENABLED = TRUE
    ```

    
    ```bash
    AIMonitoring.Streaming.Enabled = TRUE
    ```


    ```bash
    NEW_RELIC_AI_MONITORING_INCLUDE_ONLY
    ```
    </Collapser>

* When you disable distributed tracing or enable high security mode, the agent will not capture AI data. 
* You can refer to the [Go configuration doc](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration/#ai-monitoring) to learn more about AI monitoring configurations.
