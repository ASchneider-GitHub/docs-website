You need to install the Node.js agent and enable AI monitoring with agent configurations. Follow our manual installation procedures in our [Node.js installation doc](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent).

When you've finished all of the procedures in your install, return to this doc to configure your agent to recognize AI data. Keep in mind that you need to enable AI monitoring for the agent to recognize and correlate AI data from your APM data.
