To start monitoring your AI-powered app, you need to install an APM agent that can collect and send data to New Relic. We have two methods to install the APM agent:

* Refer to this doc to manually install the agent.
* Use our CLI installer that inspects your system and installs the agent for you.

Either option gets you started, but we recommend the guided install if you're a smaller organization or you're trying out New Relic for the first time. Once you've installed the agent, you can make configurations that program the agent to collect certain kinds of data.
