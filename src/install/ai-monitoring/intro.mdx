When you install AI monitoring, you're allowing our APM agents to collect metrics and event data from AI libraries and frameworks. To get started, you'll instrument your AI-powered app with an APM agent, then update configurations to adjust the agent's behavior.

Under the hood, AI data appears like any other kind of event, trace, and log data. With AI monitoring, New Relic can identify and expose information about your AI responses.
