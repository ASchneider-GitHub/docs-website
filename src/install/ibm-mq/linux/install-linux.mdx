1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

```shell
cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

```shell
sudo cp ibmmq-config.yml.sample ibmmq-config.yml
```

3. Edit the `ibmmq-config.yml` file. This example config file collects all metrics and inventory from your localhost:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-ibmmq
    env:
      HOSTNAME: localhost
      PORT: 9200
      USERNAME: ibmmq_user
      PASSWORD: ibmmq_password
      CONFIG_PATH: /etc/ibmmq/ibmmq.yml
    interval: 15s
    labels:
      environment: production
    inventory_source: config/ibmmq
```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
