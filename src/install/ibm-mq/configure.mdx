headingText: Configure the integration
---

To configure the integration, edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `ibmmq-config.yml`. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how to collect data. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations.

To read all about these common settings, refer to our [configuration format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.
