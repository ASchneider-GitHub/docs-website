The New Relic Kafka [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) reports metrics and configuration data from your Kafka service. We instrument all the key elements of your cluster, including brokers (both ZooKeeper and Bootstrap), producers, consumers, and topics.
