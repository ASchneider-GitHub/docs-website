* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.

* Our integration is compatible with Kafka version 3 or lower.

* Check the [Apache Kafka EOL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Time+Based+Release+Plan#TimeBasedReleasePlan-WhatIsOurEOLPolicy) policy and the [End of Life](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html#cp-and-apache-ak-compatibility) Kafka version to avoid unexpected results you may have.

* If Kafka is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where Kafka is installed. Otherwise:
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Kubernetes" alt="Kubernetes" src="/images/os_icon_k8.webp"/>Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="ECS" alt="ECS" src="/images/os_icon_ecs.webp"/>Amazon ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

* Java version 8 or higher.

* JMX enabled on all brokers.

* Java-based consumers and producers only, and with JMX enabled.

* Total number of monitored topics must be fewer than 10000.

## Connectivity requirements [#connectivity-requirements]

You must configure the integration and allow it to connec to:

* Hosts listed in `zookeeper_hosts` over the Zookeeper protocol, using the Zookeeper authentication mechanism if `autodiscover_strategy` is set to `zookeeper`.

* Hosts defined in `bootstrap_broker_host` over the Kafka protocol, using the Kafka broker's authentication and transport mechanisms, if `autodiscover_strategy` is set to `bootstrap`.

* All brokers in the cluster over the Kafka protocol and port, using the Kafka brokers' authentication and transport mechanisms.

* All brokers in the cluster over the JMX protocol and port, using the authentication and transport mechanisms specified in the JMX configuration of the brokers.

* All producers and consumers specified in producers and consumers over the JMX protocol and port, if you want producer and consumer monitoring. JMX settings for the consumer must be the same as for the brokers.

<Callout variant="important">
  By default, security groups and their equivalents in other cloud providers in AWS, don't have the required ports open by default. JMX requires 2 ports in order to work: the JMX port and the RMI port. You can set them to the same value when configuring the JVM to enable JMX and must be open for the integration to be able to connect to and collect metrics from brokers.
