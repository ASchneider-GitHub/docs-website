headingText: Configure the vSphere integration

1. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

```
copy vSpheredb-config.yml.sample vSpheredb-config.yml
```

2. Edit the `vSpheredb-config.yml` file. The following configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost. It uses the default connection on port 1521. Do not forget to replace `SERVICE_NAME` and `vSphere_HOME` with the correct values for your environment:

```
integrations:
  - name: nri-vSpheredb
    env:
      SERVICE_NAME: vSphere
      HOSTNAME: 127.0.0.1
      PORT: 1521
      USERNAME: vSpheredb_user
      PASSWORD: vSpheredb_password
      vSphere_HOME: /app/vSphere/product/version/database
    interval: 15s
    labels:
      environment: production
    inventory_source: config/vSpheredb
```
You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
