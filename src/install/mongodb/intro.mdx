Our MongoDB integration collects and sends metrics from your MongoDB database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems.

You can view this [metric data](#metrics) in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts.
