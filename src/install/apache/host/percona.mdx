<Callout variant="tip">
    Complete these steps on the mongos to be monitored. If you want to collect mongod-level metrics,
    such as host or replica set statistics, create the role
    and user on each mongod as well.
</Callout>

1. In the  shell. switch to the admin database:

```shell
use admin
```

2. Create a new user, and assign `clusterMonitor` and `readAnyDatabase` roles to the user (adjust the `username` and `password` as required).

```
db.createUser(
    {
    user: "username",
    pwd:  "password",
    roles: [ { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" },
                { role: 'readAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' } ]
    }
)
```
