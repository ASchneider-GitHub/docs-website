1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

```shell
cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

```shell
sudo cp 3-config.yml.sample 3-config.yml
```

3. Edit the `3-config.yml` file. The only two required fields are `_cluster_name` and `_uri`. This example config file collects all metrics:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-3
    config:
      _cluster_name: my_cluster
      _uri: ://username:password@localhost:27017
      exporter_port: 9126
```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
