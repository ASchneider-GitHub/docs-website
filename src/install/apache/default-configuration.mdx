Edit the `3-config.yml` file to configure your integration as needed. The following example config fills in all the required options and reports all metrics the integration pulls:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-3
    config:
      _cluster_name: MY_CLUSTER
      _uri: ://username:password@localhost:27017
      exporter_port: 9126
```
