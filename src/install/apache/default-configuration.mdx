Edit the `nri-apache-config.yml` file to configure your integration as needed. The following example config fills in all the required options and reports all metrics the integration pulls:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-apache
    env:
      METRICS: "true"
      # status_url is used to identify the monitored entity to which the inventory will be attached.
      STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto
      REMOTE_MONITORING: true
    interval: 15s
    labels:
      env: production
      role: load_balancer

  - name: nri-apache
    env:
      INVENTORY: "true"
      # status_url is used to identify the monitored entity to which the inventory will be attached.
      STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto
      REMOTE_MONITORING: true
    interval: 60s
    labels:
      env: production
      role: load_balancer
    inventory_source: config/apache
```
