1. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

    ```shell
    copy nri-apache-config.yml.sample nri-apache-config.yml
    ```

2. Edit the `nri-apache-config.yml` file file. This example config file collects all metrics:

    ```yml
    integrations:
    - name: nri-apache
        env:
        METRICS: "true"
        # status_url is used to identify the monitored entity to which the inventory will be attached.        
        STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto
        REMOTE_MONITORING: true
        interval: 15s
        labels:
        env: production
        role: load_balancer

    - name: nri-apache
        env:
        INVENTORY: "true"
        # status_url is used to identify the monitored entity to which the inventory will be attached.        
        STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto
        REMOTE_MONITORING: true
        interval: 60s
        labels:
        env: production
        role: load_balancer
        inventory_source: config/apache
    ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
