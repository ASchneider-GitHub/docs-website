headingText: Install the infrastructure agent
---

To use the Apache integration, you need to also install the infrastructure agent on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with specific data such as database and instance metrics.

If you don't already have the infrastructure agent installed, choose one of the following options. Both of the options below take you out of this installation routine, so we recommend you open the instructions in another tab so you can return here after you've installed the infrastructure agent.

* Run the guided install using our CLI (recommended for testing environments):
