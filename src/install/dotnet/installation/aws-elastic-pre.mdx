Make sure you have a supported [Amazon Web Services account](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). In addition, for any New Relic installation, you will need your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window") for your account. You may also want to install the New Relic Infrastructure agent on your Elastic Beanstalk instances; refer to [Configure the infrastructure agent on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/configure-infrastructure-agent-aws-elastic-beanstalk/) for more details.
