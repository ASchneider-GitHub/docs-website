Before installing the agent using NuGet, understand these important points:

* In order to configure environment variables and directory permissions, you must have access to the systems where you're deploying your applications.
* If you're using NuGet to update an existing .NET agent, this will overwrite any previous changes to [`newrelic.config`](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration). To preserve changes, save the config file outside of your project, then restore it after updating.

  The agent's `logs` folder gets created as a subfolder of the `newrelic` folder in your application's build/publish output directory. The `logs` folder gets created with default permissions, meaning that it may not be writable by the agent if your app is run by a different user than the user who built/published the app. Make sure that the user your app runs as can write to the `logs` folder.
