<Callout variant="important">
  The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old `packages.config`. They do not support the new `PackageReference` format. For more information see [Microsoft's package reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files)

For multi-project solutions, make sure you've selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package.
