headingText: Configure the integration
---

Upon installation, the integration should start reporting to your New Relic account with the default counters defined in `config.json`. 

To further configure your integration, use any of the command-line arguments listed at the bottom of this doc. You'll need to edit `nri-perfmon-definition.yml` and add them as argument lines, like so:

```yaml
#
# New Relic Infrastructure Perfmon Integration
#
name: com.newrelic.perfmon
description: Perfmon On-Host Integration
protocol_version: 1
os: windows
commands:
  metrics:
    command:
      - .\nri-perfmon\nri-perfmon.exe
      - -i
      - 60000
      - -c
      - custom_config.json
      - -n
      - MyCompName
    prefix: integration/nri-perfmon
    interval: 15
```

The `interval:` field at the bottom does need to be there with a number, but it does not change the polling interval. To do that, add `-i` and `<interval_(ms)>` as consecutive lines to your `command` arguments.

More complex examples and options, such as remote polling and custom counters, are found at the bottom of this doc.
