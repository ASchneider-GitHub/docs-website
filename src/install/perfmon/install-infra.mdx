headingText: Install the infrastructure agent

To use the PerfMon integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The agent collects data from PerfMon and sends it to New Relic.
