headingText: Integrate CloudWatch Metric Streams
---

Once your permissions are set, you can set up the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. We have a few different methods depending on your preference:

* You can follow our in-app guided install, which directs you to the New Relic platform where you'll create Cloudformation template for CloudWatch Metric Streams. You may want to return to this doc to review the CloudFormation template parameters.
* You can follow some procedures that use AWS Console to create resources yourself.
* If you're currently using API polling, you can follow some procedures to migrate to CloudWatch Metric Streams.
