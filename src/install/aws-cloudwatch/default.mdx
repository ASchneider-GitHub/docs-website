Once your permissions are set, you can set up the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. We have a few different methods depending on your preference:

* You can follow our in-app guided install, which directs you to the New Relic platform where you'll follow a guided install to create Cloudformation template for CloudWatch Metric Streams. You may want to return to this doc to review the CloudFormation template parameters.
* You can follow some manual procedures that lets you use AWS Console or APIs to create the resources you'll need yourself.
* If you're currently forwarding your data with API polling, we strongly recommend you work through the migration procedures in this doc.
