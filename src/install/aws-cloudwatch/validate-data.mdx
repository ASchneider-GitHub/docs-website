To confirm you're receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>, and search for the <DNT>**Stream**</DNT> accounts.
2. Check the following:

   * Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that New Relic receives the metric data (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.)
   * Explore your data. Use metrics and events to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric, and more.

It may take few minutes until new resources are detected and synthesized as entities. See [cloud integrationssystem limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits) for more information.
