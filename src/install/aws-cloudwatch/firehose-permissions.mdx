Minimal permissions and mapping instructions 
To enrich CloudWatch metrics with additional service metadata and custom tags, any AWS role configured in New Relic must be granted the following minimal permissions:

```json
config:BatchGetResourceConfig
config:ListDiscoveredResources
elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters
tag:GetResources
```

The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams.

New Relic and AWS accounts and regions mapping 
If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic.
If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic.
You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account.
