headingText: Configure the integration
---



To enable the integration, edit and save the `winservices-config.yml`:

* Uncomment `exporter_bind_address:` and `exporter_bind_port:`
* Add the name of the services you want to monitor to `include_matching_entities:`

By default, no service is included. To include and filter services, you must edit `include_matching_entities:`.

Also, the configuration option [`inventory_source`](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format) is not compatible with the integration.

Here's an example of the Windows services integration configuration with both a regex pattern matching all services named `win32.*` and a direct match for the `newrelic-infra` service:

    integrations:
      - name: nri-winservices
        config:
          exporter_bind_address: 127.0.0.1
          exporter_bind_port: 9182
          include_matching_entities:
            windowsService.name:
              - regex "win32.*"
              - "newrelic-infra"
          scrape_interval: 30s
        timeout: 60s
    ```
