The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects telemetry data from your cluster using several New Relic integrations such as the [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/kubernetes-events-integration/), the [Prometheus Agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/), and the [New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/).

Read on to install the integration and to see what data we collect.

The guided install makes it easy to install the New Relic Kubernetes integration. It lets you choose which features to enable, which data to collect, and provides a [quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/kubernetes) option. It includes some optional, pre-built resources like dashboards and alerts. They come with the Kubernetes integration and allow you to get immediate visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

We recommend this interactive installation tool for servers, VMs, and [unprivileged](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes) environments.

For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.
