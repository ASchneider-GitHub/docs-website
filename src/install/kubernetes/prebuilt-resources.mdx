After deploying this integration, you can add these pre-built resources:

* A default **set of pre-built alert policies**. You can add them to your account, and then customize the [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/) to meet your needs. See [Pre-built alert policies](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-prebuilt-alert-policies) for more information about managing them.

* **Pre-built dasboards**. Follow these steps to add pre-defined dashboards:

  1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > + Integrations & Agents**</DNT>. 

  2. Select <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> to access the pre-built resources. 

  3. Search <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT> and select the dashboard you want to add.
