Depending on whether you choose automatic or manual injection to install New Relic full observability in your EKS Fargate cluster, the configuration may vary.

    You can configure different aspects of the automatic injection. By default, the operator will inject the monitoring sidecar to all pods deployed in Fargate nodes which are not part of a `Job` or a `BatchJob`.

    This behavior can be changed through configuration options. For example, you can define selectors to narrow or widen the selection of pods that are injected, assign resources to the operator, and tune the sidecar. Also, you can add other attributes, labels, and environment variables. Please refer to the chart [`README.md`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-infra-operator/README.md) and [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-infra-operator/values.yaml).

    <Callout variant="important">
        Specifying your own custom injection rules will discard the default ruleset that prevents sidecar injection on pods that are not scheduled in Fargate. Please ensure that your custom rules have the same effect; otherwise, on hybrid clusters which also have the `DaemonSet` deployed, pods scheduled in EC2 will be monitored twice, leading to incorrect or duplicate data.

    When adding the manifest of the sidecar agent manually, you can use any agent configuration option to configure the agent behavior. For help, see [Infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/).
