[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes.

New Relic provides various Helm charts for different components, each with unique features for the platform:

* [`newrelic-infrastructure`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/tree/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure): Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience. It reports most of the data in the Kubernetes dashboard and the Kubernetes cluster explorer.
* [`newrelic-logging`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging): Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) output [plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to easily forward your logs to [New Relic](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).
* [`nri-kube-events`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kube-events/tree/main/charts/nri-kube-events): Collects and reports cluster events, such as `kubectl get events` to New Relic.
* [`newrelic-prometheus-agent`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/tree/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent): New Relic's Prometheus configurator configures a [Prometheus in agent mode](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/) and use our remote write endpoint to [reports metrics to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#remote-write).
* [`nri-metadata-injection`](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-metadata-injection/tree/main/charts/nri-metadata-injection): Sets up a minimal `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` that injects a couple of environment variables in the containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to [correlate APM and infrastructure data](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-apm-applications-kubernetes/).
* [`nri-statsd`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-statsd): New Relic StatsD integration.

Although you can install these components separately, we strongly recommend you use the [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart. New Relic provides this chart, which acts as a wrapper or a meta-package for the individual charts mentioned above. The use of this chart enables you these advantages: 

- It provides full control over which components are installed. Each component is installed as a separate [Helm dependency](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#overriding-values-from-a-parent-chart). You can configure them individually using the parameters mentioned [here](#configure).
- It ensures that their installed versions are compatible with each other.
- It ensures that their configuration values are consistent across the installed charts.

The `nri-bundle` chart is the one that is installed and configured by our [Kubernetes guided install](/install/kubernetes/).
