* You need a New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. You can set up a free account, no credit card required.

* Be sure you're using a supported Kubernetes version and distribution, check out the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements) page. You'll also find [Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements/#req-helm) and [Manifest](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements/#req-manifest) requirements.

* Check you've added the [New Relic dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/newrelic) and Google's [`registry.k8s.io`](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io) domains to your allow list. The installation pulls the container images from this location. You may need to follow the [commands](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/#how-can-i-check-if-i-am-impacted) to find the extra Google registry domains to add to your whitelist. `registry.k8s.io` usually redirects to your local registry domain. For example, `asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev` based on your region.
