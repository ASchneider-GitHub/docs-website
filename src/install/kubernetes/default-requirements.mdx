* Make sure you've your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. You can set up a free account, no credit card required.

* Make sure you're using the supported Kubernetes versions and check out the preliminary notes for your managed services or platforms on our [compatibility and requirements page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements).

* Make sure you've added the [New Relic dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/newrelic) and Google's [`registry.k8s.io`](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io) domains to your allow list. This is the location from which the installation will pull the container images. You may need to follow the [commands](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/#how-can-i-check-if-i-am-impacted) to find the extra Google registry domains to add to your whitelist. `registry.k8s.io` usually redirects to your local registry domain. For example, `asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev` based on your region.

**Compatibility and requirements for Helm**

* Make sure you've [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm?tab=readme-ov-file#install) installed on your machine. Version 3 of the Kubernetes integration requires Helm version 3.

* Choose a display name for your cluster. For example, you could use this output:

    ```shell
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

**Compatibility and requirements for Manifest**

* If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, you will need to first remove the old installation using `kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml`, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using `kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml`.
