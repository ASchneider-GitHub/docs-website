1. **Configure the Kubernetes Integration**

Complete these fields:

    * **Choose a Kubernetes cluster name**. Cluster name is the name we will use to tag your Kubernetes data with so that you can filter for the data specific to the cluster you're installing this integration in. This is important if you choose to connect multiple clusters to your New Relic account so choose a name that you'll recognize.

    * **Namespace for the integration (default: newrelic)**. Namespace for the integration is the namespace we will use to house the Kubernetes integration in your cluster. We recommend using the default namespace of `newrelic`.

    * **Are you using a GKE Autopilot cluster?**. If you select this option, these parameters will change: 

        * Privileged, ControlPlane and Pixie set to false.
        * Kubelet scheme set to HTTP.
        * Kubelet port to 10255.


2. Scrape Prometheus data

We recommend you select the option **Scrape all Prometheus endpoints except core Kubernetes system metrics**. The integration already collects core Kubernetes system metrics in other components.

3. Gather log data

Configure your log data for all containers running in the cluster.
