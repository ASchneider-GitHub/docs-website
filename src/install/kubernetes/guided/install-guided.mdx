import kubernetesGuidedInstall from 'images/kubernetes_screenshot-crop_guided-install-ui.webp'



The guided installation gives you control over the process, allowing you to choose which features to enable and which data to collect. It makes the installation process easier and simpler than the other ways to install the integration. It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

From the guided install, you can choose from one of these instrumentation methods:

* **Guided**. It automates your installation by running a simple script.
* **Helm**. A Helm chart values file with pre-populated required parameters.
* **Manifest**. A manifest yaml file with pre-populated required parameters.
