The guided install experience simplifies the installation process for the New Relic Kubernetes integration, and gives you control over which features are enabled and what data is collected. It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

From the guided install, you can choose from one of these instrumentation methods:

* New Relic CLI. It automates your installation by running a simple script.
* A Helm chart values file with pre-populated required parameters.
* A manifest yaml file with pre-populated required parameters.
