With our Active Directory integration, you can easily monitor the health of your directory services environment and proactively alert on potential issues. 

Built with our infrastructure agent, the Active Directory integration gives you a set of pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and <InlinePopover type ="alerts" /> that let you view your most critical performance data, all in one place.

After setting up the Active Directory integration with New Relic, see your data in a dashboard like this, right out of the box.

**Use guided install to quickly see your data in the UI**

The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your Active Directory services. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.

For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the integrations: keep reading for how to do that.
