The collection of telemetry from Active Directory depends on various configuration and script files located in the infrastructure agent's directory structure like this:

```
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\
    ├── integrations.d
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.ps1
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.yml
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-checks.yml
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-failures.ps1
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-partners.ps1
    │   └── windows-active-directory-services.yml
    └── logging.d
        └── windows-active-directory.yml
```

Each of these files works together to present a full observability footprint. The resulting telemetry in New Relic consists of Metrics, Events, and Log data.
